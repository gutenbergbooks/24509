<h3 class="chap">SOMEWHAT CONTAGIOUS</h3>


<p class="first"><span>It</span> is October and the mountains are
waking from their short winter sleep.</p>

<p>It is October, the month of the moving
mists.</p>

<p>Come and let us take a walk, not down
Fleet Street with Dr. Johnson, but up a
mountain side with Nature,&mdash;nay, with God
Himself. There is nothing to see, absolutely
nothing at all. You know that there are
trees on either hand of you, and that the
undergrowth is bursting into the stars and
delicate bells of its springtime bloom. But
your knowledge of this is merely one of the
services your memory does for you, for the
mist has covered it all away from sight.</p>

<p>You look behind you and your world is
blotted out.</p>

<p>You look in front of you,&mdash;nay, you cannot
look in front of you, for the mist lies as a
veil, actually on your face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I breathed up a whole cloud this morning,&rdquo;
Lynn remarked once.</p>

<p><a name="png.012" id="png.012"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">10</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;I eated one&mdash;and it was nasty,&rdquo; said
Max.</p>

<p>Still you continue to look in front of you as
far as may be.</p>

<p>And the next moment the veil lifts,&mdash;clean
up over your head perhaps, and you see
it rolling away on the wind to one side of you,
yards and yards of flying white gossamer, its
ragged edges catching in the trees.</p>

<p>And now your gaze leaps and lingers, and
lingers and leaps for miles in front of you.
You look downward and the ball of the earth
has split at your feet and the huge fissure has
widened and widened till a limitless valley
lies there. You look down hundreds of feet
and see like sprouting seedlings the tops of
gum trees,&mdash;gum trees two hundred feet
high.</p>

<p>The far side of the valley shows a rolling
mountain chain washed in in tender shades of
purple, paling nearer at hand to blue, the
tender indescribable mountain blue. Great
jagged headlands hang perilously over the
deep, and the silver thread of a distant waterfall
gleams here and there down the face of the
gorges of whose wonderful beauty the tourist
has heard and comes thousands of miles to
see.</p>

<p>A billowy cloud, soft and dazzling as snow,
has fallen from the sky or risen with the mist,
you are not sure which, and lies bewilderingly
<a name="png.013" id="png.013"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">11</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>low and lovely on the purple hills.
Then there comes that damp, delicate sensation
on your face and all is mist again.</p>

<p>It is just as if a lovely girl now playfully
hid her exquisite face with the gauzy scarf
twined round her head, and now showed it,
each fresh glimpse revealing a newer and
tenderer beauty.</p>

<p>Lynn, who, though but eight, is given to
quaint and delicate turns of thought, calls it
all &ldquo;God&#8217;s kaleidoscope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nearer to the station cluster the weatherboard
business places of the little township
of Burunda. The butcher does a trade of
perhaps two sheep a week during the winter,
but leaps to many a score of them when
&ldquo;the strangers&rdquo; begin to come up from the
moist city at the first touch of November&#8217;s
heat. The bakers&mdash;there are two of them&mdash;fight
bitterly for &ldquo;the strangers&#8217;&rdquo; custom.</p>

<p>All the winter a few decrepit-looking tarts
and buns form the shop window display of
each. But when signs of life begin in the
cottages the battle starts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seven for sixpence,&rdquo; Benson writes in
red letters on a card in the midst of his
&ldquo;drop&rdquo; cakes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eight for sixpence,&rdquo; Dunks retorts in
larger type in the midst of <em>his</em> heap of the
popular confectionery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nine for sixpence,&rdquo; is Benson&#8217;s desperate
<a name="png.014" id="png.014"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">12</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>challenge,&mdash;the cakes of course shrinking
somewhat in size.</p>

<p>The baker does not live who can afford to
give ten for sixpence.</p>

<p>Benson has now to create new signs. &ldquo;No
second-class flour used in the cakes of <em>this</em>
establishment,&rdquo; is one of his efforts.</p>

<p>Dunks caps it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No miserable counting out of currants in
cakes baked <em>here</em>. Visitors are invited to
sample.&rdquo; And on his counter is a very fruity
specimen cut across. As a result of this
competition &ldquo;the strangers&rdquo; may count on
quite respectable cakes for their tea.</p>

<p>There are two grocers&mdash;brothers, oddly
enough, though not connected in trade;
steady, peaceable old men with whom
brotherly love continues despite trade rivalry.</p>

<p>But they possess a live young assistant
each, and it is war to the knife between these
lads.</p>

<p>They fall on the startled stranger before he
is fairly out of the train and thrust before
him the merits of their respective establishments.</p>

<p>Howie, the boy of Septimus Smith, is lean
and lanky and can stretch a long arm and a
trade card for an amazing distance to just
beneath your nose. But Larkin is small and
wiry and has a knack of squeezing himself
right into the midst of your mountain of
<a name="png.015" id="png.015"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">13</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>luggage and children and porters, and earnestly
informing you that Octavius Smith
keeps the best bacon in the district, and
promising you that if you deal with him, he,
Larkin, will bring your letters with him from
the post office every morning when he calls
for orders.</p>

<p>It is said that the loser invariably fights
the winner after these contests unless there
falls to his lot another passenger by the same
train. But if it happens that the luck is to
neither,&mdash;that is, if all are hotel or boarding-house
visitors, or (an unforgivable thing in
the eyes of both) if the newcomers are people
who bring their own groceries from the
metropolis, then the two go off almost friends
and help each other up with any boxes the
train may have brought for them.</p>

<p>The Lomax children took a keen interest in
the warfare, and always asked Larkin, when
he came for orders in the morning, how
many of the new people&#8217;s custom he had
secured.</p>

<p>For it was Larkin&#8217;s trick of insinuating
himself among the portmanteaus and confused
servants and children, and then talking
rapidly of bacon and letters, that had gained
him Mrs. Lomax&#8217;s custom when the family
first came to Burunda. That bewildered
lady simply had to consent that he might
call to get him out of the knot of seemingly
<a name="png.016" id="png.016"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">14</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>inextricable confusion with which she had to
deal.</p>

<p>There are two photographers, two shoe-menders,
two house agents, two visiting
doctors.</p>

<p>It is conceivable that if a third man of any
trade come along the character of business in
Burunda may entirely change. But while
there are but two of each, the chances are
that any day the visitors may have the quiet
monotony of the place broken up by a civil
war.</p>

<p>Not far from the station stand the hotels
and the more modest boarding-houses.</p>

<p>And then begin the cottages and villas&mdash;nearly
all of them weatherboard&mdash;of people
who like to have a foothold a few thousand
feet in the air when summer&#8217;s shroud of damp
enwraps the Harbour city.</p>

<p>The Lomax children swung disconsolately
on the gate of their summer home. All
they could see was the road in front of them,
now clear, now filled with flying mist, and
their senses were wearied of it.</p>

<p>Might they go down the gully?</p>

<p>No, they might not go down the gully.
Who had time on a busy day like this, and
Miss Bibby writing to New Zealand, to go
trapesing down all those rough places with
them?</p>

<p>Couldn&#8217;t they go alone?</p>

<p><a name="png.017" id="png.017"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">15</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>No, they could not go alone. A nice thing
it would be for the Judge&#8217;s children to be lost
down a gully and sleeping out all night.</p>

<p>Well, might they go down to the waterfall?
They couldn&#8217;t get lost on made paths
and with picnickers everywhere.</p>

<p>No, they might not go down to the waterfall.
What would the Judge say if he heard
his children had been down a dangerous
place like that and no one with them!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let us go up to the shops and the
station. We&#8217;ve got twopence between us,
and we want to spend it, and besides&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
But Pauline broke off, recognizing it was
worse than useless to explain to a person like
Anna the pleasure they could obtain from
watching to see whether Howie or their own
Larkin got most of the customers by the
excursion train. But Anna was horrified at
the idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In those dusty clothes and with your
sandals off! A nice condition for the shopkeepers
to see a Judge&#8217;s children in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hang a Judge&#8217;s children,&rdquo; muttered
Pauline, but not until Anna had returned to
the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wish daddy was a butcher,&rdquo; said Muffie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a butcher,&rdquo; said Lynn, who was
sensitive and never could pass the shop of
hanging carcases without a shudder,&mdash;&ldquo;but
a baker would be <em>very</em> nice, and make drop
<a name="png.018" id="png.018"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">16</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>cakes seven for sixpence. Oh, I <em>could</em> eat a
drop cake,&mdash;couldn&#8217;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Benson&#8217;s one,&rdquo; said Pauline dreamily;
&ldquo;they&#8217;re the sweetest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there are more currants in Dunks&#8217;s,&rdquo;
said Muffie. &ldquo;I shall spend my penny there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&#8217;t,&rdquo; said Lynn, who was subject
to fits of pessimism, &ldquo;you&#8217;ll never spend it.
Anna will never have finished washing up.
Miss Bibby will never have finished writing to
mamma. We&#8217;ll never get up to the shops.
We&#8217;ll have to stop shut up here <em>for ever</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why,&rdquo; said Muffie, who was only six,
and easily bewildered by words, &ldquo;why can&#8217;t
we do like always and ever when we come up
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, indeed!&rdquo; said Pauline with much
bitterness.</p>

<p>Max, the only son of the Judge and aged
just four, had a clear way of his own of arriving
at the cause of various effects.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wish a late big lecipice would fall on
Anna,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Max,&rdquo; said Lynn, whose unspent
penny was burning a hole in her temper,
&ldquo;you are getting too big to talk like that.
Late big lecipice! Say, <em>great big precipice.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Max indignantly,&mdash;&ldquo;I&#8217;ll
push you off the gate in a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&#8217;t dare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, wouldn&#8217;t I?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.019" id="png.019"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">17</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;If you move your foot I&#8217;ll jerk you off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, don&#8217;t begin that,&rdquo; said Pauline,
&ldquo;you&#8217;ll make him cough again,&mdash;let him
alone, Lynn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he <ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
  original reads 'musn&#8217;t'">mustn&#8217;t</ins> say he&#8217;ll push me off,&rdquo;
said Lynn. &ldquo;I&#8217;m only trying to teach him
to talk prop&#8217;ly. This morning he asked
Larkin to come and look at his lee lowing in
the lound. And I had to explain that he
meant &lsquo;tree growing in the ground.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Max was red with anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&#8217;t say that,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;I said
plain&#8217;s anything lee lowing in the <em>lound</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sent each of the difficult words from
his mouth with a snap, as if he were discharging
them from a pistol that jammed.</p>

<p>But Lynn jeered again.</p>

<p>He could not jerk her from the gate, though
he tried hard; eight years old can effect
a much firmer lodgment than four years. He
sheltered himself behind his weakness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ll make <em>me</em> cough in a minute,&rdquo; he
said, and began to draw in his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ll make me cough,&rdquo; said Lynn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cough worser than you,&rdquo; insisted Max.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&#8217;t,&mdash;I get <em>much</em> redder,&rdquo; said Lynn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I go purple, Miss Bibby says so,&rdquo; said
Muffie complacently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I go nearly lack in the face,&rdquo; said Max.</p>

<p>It was possible that Pauline, who being ten
was always superior, would have laid claim
<a name="png.020" id="png.020"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">18</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>herself to some still darker shade of complexion
but that a diversion occurred at the moment.</p>

<p>One or two people carrying golf clubs had
passed along the monotonous road during the
morning and Max had longed to be a caddie.
Once a woodcutter had gone along with his
axe over his shoulder and Lynn had been
moved to recite&mdash;to the disgust of the others&mdash;&ldquo;Woodman,
spare that tree.&rdquo; And once
Larkin had flashed past on horseback, Howie
tearing along not far behind, it having come
to their ears five minutes before that a cottage
far away through the bush was opened, its
occupants having come up by the night train.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I grow up,&rdquo; said Muffie enviously,
&ldquo;I&#8217;ll be a grocer&#8217;s boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&#8217; I&#8217;ll be the other one,&rdquo; said Max, so
filled with glorious visions suddenly that he
forgot his original intention of coughing.</p>

<p>But now there came briskly round the corner
one of the big Burunda wagonettes, overflowing
with ladies and children and picnic
baskets and plainly bound for the waterfall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Lynn excitedly, &ldquo;there are
Effie and Florence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Frank,&rdquo; cried Muffie joyously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said one of the ladies in the
wagonette, &ldquo;there are the little Lomaxes,&mdash;I
didn&#8217;t know they were up.&rdquo; She stopped the
driver.</p>

<p><a name="png.021" id="png.021"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">19</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Lynn and Muffie and Max were for rushing
out and charging bodily into the vehicle,
and indeed one of the ladies was beckoning
encouragingly to them all.</p>

<p>Lynn&#8217;s swift imagination saw themselves
borne joyously off to the loved waterfall;
she felt the very water of the cool delicious
pools on her hot feet.</p>

<p>But Pauline, with a look of absolute tragedy
on her fair little face, banged the gate and
kept her brothers and sisters on the hither
side of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;re contagious,&rdquo; she shouted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha-a-at?&rdquo; said the lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whooping cough,&rdquo; said Pauline with
extreme dejection in her tone, and as if for a
guarantee of her veracity Max was seized
with a paroxysm then and there, and Muffie
followed suit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, drive on!&rdquo; cried the lady hastily to
her man, and gave an alarmed look at her own
little flock. But she pulled up again fifty
yards away and came back on foot and stood
a very respectable distance away from the
infected spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m so sorry, chickies,&rdquo; she said kindly;
&ldquo;that&#8217;s a wretched visitor for the holidays.
Have you been very bad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I go nearly lack in the face,&rdquo; said Max,
not without pride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is mother with you?&rdquo; said the lady,
<a name="png.022" id="png.022"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">20</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Mrs. Gowan by name, somewhat anxiously,
&ldquo;and your father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Pauline sadly, &ldquo;they&#8217;ve gone
to New Zealand,&mdash;mamma got quite ill with
nursing us, and daddie got it too, and he
wouldn&#8217;t come up here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Muffie giggled. &ldquo;People&#8217;s laugh &#8217;cause
daddie&#8217;s got it,&rdquo; she volunteered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But in New Zealand, you see,&rdquo; explained
Pauline gravely, &ldquo;no one will know him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Gowan smiled a little&mdash;as others had
done. For indeed the thought of a dignified
Judge drawing in his breath and whooping on
the bench like a frightened child was not without
its humorous side.</p>

<p>The poor Judge had become quite sensitive
about the ridiculous complaint his children
had given to him, and after struggling with
it pettishly for some time, and the vacation
coming along, he had finally proposed the
New Zealand trip to his wife, the children
being sent to complete their cure to the summer
home he had long since built on the
mountains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gowan, &ldquo;I am really
sorry, dears, for we could have had such fun,
all of us up here at the same time, couldn&#8217;t
we? But you won&#8217;t speak to Effie and
Florence if you meet them anywhere, will
you? Even if they try to speak to you?
I have such a dread of whooping cough.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.023" id="png.023"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">21</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Paul told you straight away off that we
were contagerous,&rdquo; said Lynn, a little hurt
that after her sister&#8217;s magnificent honesty
such admonition should be deemed necessary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, dear,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;and
indeed I thank Pauline very much for being
so considerate. It is Effie and Florence I
am thinking of; they are so thoughtless, I
am afraid they will try to come over to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;d better not let them come down to
this part of the road then,&rdquo; said Pauline
sagely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that&#8217;s the difficulty,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Gowan, &ldquo;their uncle has taken &lsquo;Tenby&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;she
waved her hand to the cottage opposite
that had stood irksomely monotonous with
closed shutters and chained gate ever since
the Lomaxes had come to Burunda this
year, &ldquo;and of course they will often want to
come down to him to listen to his stories.
He is Hugh Kinross, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did not know, and even now the
name was a name to them and nothing more.
Mrs. Gowan evidently took it for granted
that even children must have heard of her
brother, the famous author.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you will help me, won&#8217;t you, Pauline?&rdquo;
she said appealingly,&mdash;&ldquo;you won&#8217;t let Max
and Muffie run out and talk to them! And
if they try to come here you will send them
away, won&#8217;t you, dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.024" id="png.024"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">22</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Pauline promised her co-operation, though
indeed her heart sank at the prospect of seeing
her merry little friend Effie day after day
as close as the opposite fence and never as
much as exchanging chocolates with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When is he coming?&rdquo; she said heavily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gowan&mdash;then she
laughed&mdash;&ldquo;but I think he would be afraid to
come, don&#8217;t you, if he knew he was going to
have four little rackets like you for such near
neighbours. He has come all this way to be
perfectly quiet and write his new book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lynn looked quite impressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we&#8217;d better stop in the orchard,&rdquo;
she said soberly.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">Mrs. Gowan kissed her hand to them and
went off laughing to her wagonette.</p>

<h3 class="chap">TREATING OF LARKIN AND HIS COMMISSION</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="uc"><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;W</span>ell,&rdquo;</span> said Lynn, looking across at
&ldquo;Tenby,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s going to
be lived in at last, poor thing. It makes me
quite mis&#8217;rable to see it standing there in
the sun with its eyes shut up tight as if it
wanted to wake up on&#8217;y it darerunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like the Sleeping Beauty,&rdquo; said Pauline.</p>

<p>Lynn, in whose composition had run from
babyhood a marked vein of poetry, shook her
hair back from her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I made a song about it down at the
waterfall the other day,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Only
mamma wasn&#8217;t here to write it down, and I
didn&#8217;t know if you could spell all the words,
Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;as if I
couldn&#8217;t spell any word a child like you could
think of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, write it then,&rdquo; urged Lynn, &ldquo;and
I can send it in my next letter to mamma;
the rhyums in it came quite right this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Pauline, having nothing better to do,
<a name="png.026" id="png.026"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">24</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and anxious to display her spelling prowess,
fished out of her pocket a bit of pencil and
one of Octavius Smith&#8217;s trade cards that
drew attention to his prime line of bacon.
This last Larkin had pressed upon her that
very morning, and urged her to put it on the
mantelpiece, where their visitors could see
it. They owed him a return. Morning after
morning did he, after receiving his orders
from Miss Bibby at the kitchen door, ride his
horse to the road at one side of the house,
where some well-grown pines made a kindly
screen, and there let the children, one after the
other, have all the delights of a stolen ride.
The ever-present dread of Miss Bibby&#8217;s discovery
naturally added a fearful joy to the
proceedings &ldquo;A judge&#8217;s eldest daughter
astride a grocer&#8217;s horse!&rdquo; Pauline could
readily imagine the lady&#8217;s tone of horror.</p>

<p>It seemed very easy repayment for the
happiest moment of the dull day to promise
to put this advertisement in evidence. But
at present it was only the white back of
the card that was pressed into service.</p>

<p>Lynn&#8217;s eyes grew round and solemn, as
they always did when she was delivering
herself of a &ldquo;song.&rdquo; She stared hard at
the shuttered house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call it &lsquo;The Very Sad House,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Very Sad House,&rsquo;&rdquo; wrote Pauline
obediently.</p>

<p><a name="png.027" id="png.027"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">25</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;No, cross that out,&rdquo; said Lynn; &ldquo;I remember
I thought of a better name. It&#8217;s
called &lsquo;Forsaked.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pauline grumbled at this. &ldquo;You mustn&#8217;t
alter any more,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;even writing very
small I can&#8217;t get much in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lynn, &ldquo;write this down.&rdquo;
And she dictated slowly. And slowly and a
little painfully, for the space was cramped,
Pauline wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div>&ldquo;&lsquo;Silent and sad it wates by the road,</div>
<div class="i4">And it&#8217;s eyes are shut with tears.</div>
<div class="i2">Oh, Tenby, my heart is so greavous for you,</div>
<div class="i4">You haven&#8217;t woked up for years.</div>
<div class="i2">Why don&#8217;t you open your eyelids up wide</div>
<div class="i2">And laugh and dance and frolick outside?</div>
<div class="i2">And why don&#8217;t&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;There can&#8217;t be any more,&rdquo; said Pauline
inexorably; &ldquo;I&#8217;m at the bottom of the card.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the little poetess piteously,
&ldquo;you must put in the end lines,&mdash;can&#8217;t you
turn over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, go on,&rdquo; said Pauline&mdash;&ldquo;but it&#8217;s
very silly. As if a house <em>could</em> frolic outside
of itself! Mother will laugh like anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Lynn&#8217;s face was trustfully serene.
Mother never laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she said,&mdash;&ldquo;the next line is,
&lsquo;Out on the grass.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&#8217;t write stories,&rdquo; said Pauline
<a name="png.028" id="png.028"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">26</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>decisively. &ldquo;There&#8217;s not a bit of grass in that
garden, and you know there isn&#8217;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lynn looked distressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there ought to be,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there <em>isn&#8217;t</em>,&rdquo; repeated Pauline; &ldquo;and
I tell you I won&#8217;t write untruths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Lynn meekly, &ldquo;it can
be earth, only it doesn&#8217;t sound so green. Say,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i2"><span class="ns"><br /></span>&lsquo;Out on the earth where the fairies play;</div>
<div class="i2">Come and play with us, oh, come and play.&rsquo;&rdquo;</div>
</div>

<p><span class="ns"><br /></span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Out on the earth where the fairies play,&rsquo;&rdquo;
wrote Pauline, and the next line said, &ldquo;Prime
middle cuts at Octavius Smith&#8217;s, Elevenpence
a pound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&#8217;s Larkin,&rdquo; called Muffie excitedly,
&ldquo;an&#8217; he&#8217;s coming very slowly, so he can&#8217;t be
in a hurry. Let&#8217;s ask him for another ride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The four clambered on to the gate again.</p>

<p>Larkin was riding back with lowered crest.</p>

<p>He was a thin lad, small for fourteen, with
sharp features and blue eyes, and a head of
hair nearer in shade to an orange than to the
lowly carrot to which red hair is popularly
likened. He wore a khaki coat a size too
small for him, and an old Panama hat some
big-headed &ldquo;stranger&rdquo; had left behind.
Round this latter dangled a string veil that
he had manufactured for himself against the
ubiquitous and famous mountain fly.</p>

<p><a name="png.029" id="png.029"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">27</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>But the flamboyant head drooped wretchedly
just at present.</p>

<p>He pulled up at the gate, seeing Miss Bibby
was not on guard, and poured out a graphic
account of the ride between himself and
Howie. Browning&#8217;s &ldquo;Ghent to Aix&rdquo; was
nothing to it, and &ldquo;How we beat the
Favourite&rdquo; was colourless narrative to the early
part of Larkin&#8217;s recital. But then the tragedy
happened. Larkin&#8217;s horse got a pebble in its
foot, and went dead lame. Howie shot ahead
and caught the lady of the house just as she
was reluctantly sallying forth to find one of
his trade and leave her order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&#8217; she&#8217;s got a baby&mdash;patent foods and
biscuits,&rdquo; said Larkin in a choked voice,
&ldquo;and I saw quite four boys,&mdash;oatmeal, tins
of jam, bacon, butter,&mdash;I wouldn&#8217;t have lost
her for anything. An&#8217; only for giving you
kids a ride this morning I&#8217;d have heard sooner,
an&#8217; got the start of Howie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The children felt quite crushed to think
they were the cause of Larkin&#8217;s great loss.
For a loss it was indeed; both boys received
commissions on the accounts of the new
customers they obtained, and a lady with a
baby and four hungry boys, not to mention a
maid or two, and possible visitors, was not to
be picked up every day.</p>

<p>Then Pauline had a brilliant thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know of another new one,&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p><a name="png.030" id="png.030"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">28</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tenby&rsquo; is taken; a man&#8217;s coming up by to-night&#8217;s
train. Howie doesn&#8217;t know, no one
knows but ourselves,&mdash;that will make up to
you, Larkin. Men eat more than babies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Larkin was greatly excited. He made
rapid plans: he would slip his cards under
the door to-night; he would present himself
at the house the moment it was unlocked in
the morning. He would take butter, eggs,
sugar, with him, so that breakfast at least
would be comfortable, and the wife or housekeeper,
or maiden sister, whichever the &ldquo;man&rdquo;
brought with him, would bless his thoughtfulness,
and promptly promise her custom.</p>

<p>Then his jaw dropped with a sudden
recollection.</p>

<p>To-morrow was his holiday&mdash;the only whole
week-day holiday he received in six months.
He had arranged to go home, as he always
did, catching the 11 o&#8217;clock train that night,
and travelling through the midnight to the
highest point of the mountains, and into the
early dawn down, down the Great Zigzag on
the other side, till he came out on the plain
to a little siding, where he scrambled out
with his bundle, and shouldered it briskly, and
trudged along eight miles, perhaps, to a
wretched selection where his father, for his
mother and six or seven children younger than
Larkin, fought the losing fight of the Man
on the Land. A few hours here, slipping
<a name="png.031" id="png.031"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">29</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>his wages into his mother&#8217;s reluctant hand,
escorted by his father round the place to see
the latest devices for trapping rabbits and
other pests, telling his brothers stirring tales
of the struggles between himself and Howie,
then the long tramp to the station, and the
travelling through the night again, snatching
his only chance of sleep sitting upright in his
crowded carriage, he fitted his holidays
naturally into the Railway Commissioners&#8217;
Cheap Excursion seasons. And then the fight
again in the new-born day with Howie.</p>

<p>The lad looked miserable. How could he
give up such a holiday? Yet how allow
Howie an uncontested victory with the latest
stranger?</p>

<p>Max and Muffie had run back along the
path in pursuit of a lively lizard. Only Lynn
and Pauline, their sweet little faces ashine
with sympathy, hung on the gate.</p>

<p>The lad blurted out his highest hope to
them. He gave his mother his wages, of
course, he told them, but he had been saving
up his commissions for a special purpose.
He wanted to put &ldquo;a bit of stuff&rdquo; on the
Melbourne Cup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I&#8217;ll win,&rdquo; he said, with glistening
eyes. &ldquo;It&#8217;ll be five hundred at least,&mdash;p&#8217;raps
a cool thou,&mdash;then I&#8217;ll buy Octavius and
Septimus out, and mother and the old man
shall chuck up that dirty selection, and come
<a name="png.032" id="png.032"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">30</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>an&#8217; get all the custom here. And the kids
can go to school, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll get Polly an&#8217; Blarnche
a pianner.&rdquo; The rapt look of the visionary
was on his face.</p>

<p>But he was torn with the conflict; it was
plain he must give up either his holiday or his
commission on the new &ldquo;stranger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pauline&#8217;s position as eldest had developed
her naturally resourceful and intrepid disposition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Larkin,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&#8217;ve thought what
to do. You go and see your mother. <em>We&#8217;ll</em>
get you the new man&#8217;s custom. And before
Howie gets a chance of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">Then Anna appeared on the verandah,
ringing the lunch bell violently, and Larkin
rode home his dead lame horse, and Pauline
marched into the house with her head up,
the other children following and clamouring
to be told of her great plan.</p>

<h3 class="chap">MISS BIBBY</h3>


<p class="first"><span>The</span> Judge&#8217;s mountain home had an inviting
aspect. It was not large,&mdash;it
was not handsome,&mdash;simply a comfortable
brick cottage with a gable or two cut to
please the eye as well as meet architectural
requirements, and a fine window here and
there where a glimpse of far-off mountain
piled against mountain could be obtained.</p>

<p>It stood back from the road and hid itself
from the picnickers&#8217; gaze in lovely garments
of trees and green vines that would take the
envious newly-sprung cottage ten years at
least to imitate.</p>

<p>Yet &ldquo;Greenways&rdquo; had never looked crude
and painful as the naked places about did,
even when it emerged years ago fresh from
the hands of the local builder. For the
Lomaxes, unlike many Australians, respected
the hand of Nature even when it had traced
Australian rather than English designs on
their land. And the young gum trees still
tossed their light heads here and there, and
<a name="png.034" id="png.034"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">32</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>clumps of noble old ones stood everywhere
smiling benevolent encouragement to the
beginners.</p>

<p>It had been the Judge&#8217;s original intention
to have nothing but native trees and shrubs
and flowers on this summer estate, and a
well-clipped hedge of saltbush at present
flanked the drive, and a breakwind plantation
of Tasmanian blue gum, alternated with silver
wattle, ran for several hundred feet where
the westerly winds had at first caught one side
of the house.</p>

<p>The tennis-court was guarded along both
ends by soldierly rows of magnificently grown
waratahs, that from October to Christmas
time were all in bloom and worth coming
far to see. And you approached that same
tennis-court through a shady plantation, where
every tree and shrub was native-born, and
the ground carpeted with gay patches of
boronia and other purely aboriginal loveliness.
Rarely did the Judge take his walks
abroad on the hills or in the gullies but he
returned carefully cherishing in one hand
some little seedling tree or plant he had dug
up with his penknife. And he would set
and water and shade it in his plantation,
and tell you its name and its species, and its
manner of growth, for the bushland was an
open book to him and every letter of it had
been lovingly conned.</p>

<p><a name="png.035" id="png.035"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">33</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>But Mrs. Lomax, English-born, while he
was Australian, through two or three generations,
hankered, after a year or two of this
native garden, for the softer and richer
greens and more varied loveliness of the trees
and flowers of English cultivation. So they
laughingly drew a line of division through
the estate; and it must be confessed that,
whatever the Judge&#8217;s opinion, the average
eye gathered more permanent pleasure and
refreshment from Mrs. Lomax&#8217;s division than
from the stiff, though brilliant, portion under
the Judge&#8217;s jurisdiction.</p>

<p>After ten years the demarcation was not
so clearly defined: pines and young oaks,
ashes and elms, stood about in perfectly
friendly relations with the gum trees and
wattles, and the boronia looked up at the rose
and saw that it, too, was good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you washed your hands? Max,
Muffie&mdash;go into the bathroom instantly,
please, and wash your hands,&rdquo; said Miss
Bibby, as the children trooped in after their
interview with Larkin.</p>

<p>Dinner was spread in the dining-room as
usual. The children sighed for the times
when their mother had been with them, and
had had such a delightful habit of having
that meal served in all sorts of unexpected
places, even on days when they could not go
for an orthodox picnic. Behind the waratahs
<a name="png.036" id="png.036"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">34</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>one day&mdash;and of course they imagined themselves
waited on by a row of stiff and magnificent
footmen in red plush. Among the
wattles another time, and the wattles just in
bloom. Once in the vegetable garden with
big leaves for plates, and the tomatoes that
made the first course bending heavily on the
trellis behind their seats, and the purple
guavas that made the last hiding among
their leaves just the other side of the path.</p>

<p>It would have required an earthquake to
dislodge Miss Bibby from the stronghold of
the dining-room table.</p>

<p>She sat at the head of that table now, a
thin delicately-coloured woman not far from
forty, with a nervous mouth and anxious blue
eyes. Possibly she had been quite pretty in
youth, if ever peace and the quiet mind had
been hers. But the unrest and worry of her
look left rather a disturbed impression on
the beholder.</p>

<p>She sat at the head of the table and carved
a leg of mutton, and saw Anna putting vegetables
upon the children&#8217;s plates under silent
protest.</p>

<p>She did not believe in meat. She did not
believe in vegetables. She did not believe in
puddings. Pauline had drawn her into confessing
this at the first meal she had had with
them, and the shock was so great that Muffie
had actually burst into tears, and Max had
<a name="png.037" id="png.037"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">35</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>clambered down from his chair with the half-formed
intention of setting out at once for
New Zealand, and dragging his mother back
to her proper place.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby, however, set their minds at
rest. She had no intention of interfering
with the food they were accustomed to; only
she begged to be excused from partaking of
such herself.</p>

<p>No meat, no vegetables, no pudding, and
still alive! The children took an abnormal
interest in watching her preparations for
eating at each meal.</p>

<p>She began each day, they found out, with a
pint of hot water. Indeed they found it out
to their sorrow, for she had Mrs. Lomax&#8217;s entire
permission to work upon themselves one
or two of her hygienic reforms&mdash;if she could
only manage it.</p>

<p>So at seven o&#8217;clock, when in various stages
of their morning toilet, they were confronted
by Miss Bibby, armed with a tall jug of hot
water and five tumblers. And they found
they had to sit down on the edges of their
beds and, receiving a full tumbler, hand back
an empty one. If it had been their mother
now, they might have protested and wheedled
and got out of it in some way. But Miss
Bibby was so strange to them, so new&mdash;and
then mother had bidden them, even as she
gave them their last kiss at the station, do
<a name="png.038" id="png.038"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">36</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>all she bade them&mdash;that they found themselves
making an absolute habit of this watery
beginning to the day. Worse still, instead of
being rewarded for such heroic behaviour,
they were, in consequence of it, deprived of
the pleasant cup of cocoa or hot milk that
had always hitherto formed part of their
breakfast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I consider it perfectly uncivilized to eat
and drink at the same meal,&rdquo; Miss Bibby
said.</p>

<p>Pauline blinked at her very fast, in a way
she had when angry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Daddy and mamma always do,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For children, I mean,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby,
correcting herself. &ldquo;I trust, Pauline, you
do not think me capable of reflecting upon
the conduct of your father and mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Pauline was engrossed with her breakfast
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All food should be taken dry,&rdquo; Miss
Bibby continued; &ldquo;and your mother is
anxious that I should get you <em>into</em> good ways.
At the same time the human system needs a
certain degree of liquid, so I shall call you in
for your drink meals at eleven, and at three,
and you may also have a glass of water each
upon retiring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes it made the children quite
depressed to watch her. Pauline used to
say she would feel perfectly happy if she
<a name="png.039" id="png.039"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">37</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>could once see Miss Bibby eat a big, lovely
woolly currant bun or a plate of rich brown
sausages dished on buttered toast.</p>

<p>And Lynn&mdash;it actually moved Lynn to
poetry, the tragedy of this meagre fare.
Pauline was bidden write &ldquo;the song&rdquo; down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the name of the song,&rdquo; added the
poetess after a melancholy verse or two, &ldquo;is
&lsquo;Sorrow,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Miss Bibby.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Muffie told of the appearance of Mrs.
Gowan and the heroic conduct of Pauline in
announcing their contagion.</p>

<p>Lynn paused in her agreeable occupation
of slicing up her banana and adding strawberry
jam and milk to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From to-morrow,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we have
to keep in the orchard when we&#8217;re at home,
so the man won&#8217;t hear us shouting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What man?&rdquo; asked Miss Bibby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The one who writes books,&rdquo; said Lynn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the child talking about?&rdquo; said
Miss Bibby, looking at Pauline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At &lsquo;Tenby,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Pauline. &ldquo;Well, he
should have asked were there any children
near when he took the cottage. Why should
we give up swinging on the gate? He can
take his old books and sit on the Orphan
Rock to write them. No one will disturb
him <em>there</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <em>are</em> you talking about, children?&rdquo;
said Miss Bibby. &ldquo;Pauline, answer me
<a name="png.040" id="png.040"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">38</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>properly. I didn&#8217;t know &lsquo;Tenby&rsquo; was let. Who
has taken it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forget his name,&rdquo; said Pauline; &ldquo;please
pass the bananas. Oh, Lynn, you&#8217;ve taken
all the jam. Will you ring for some more,
Miss Bibby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Bibby rang absent-mindedly, though
she had made the observation that any one
eating bananas and strawberry jam together
was actually inviting an attack of acute
indigestion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you have confused the account,&rdquo;
she said, and sighed.</p>

<p>But a momentary agitation had shaken
her.</p>

<p>She was a woman with one absorbing
ambition&mdash;to publish a book. She carried
a most pathetic tin trunk about with her&mdash;the
sepulchre of the hopes of years. The
MS. of at least seven novels lay inside,
each neatly wrapped in paper, and with a
faithful docket of its adventures pasted
upon it.</p>

<p>It is enough to examine one of them:&mdash;<cite>The
Heirs of Tranby Chase.</cite> It weighed
four or five pounds. The publishers would
never have had to grumble at its brevity,
or have been compelled to use large type
and wide margins to &ldquo;bulk up.&rdquo; It was
written in the thin, early Victorian handwriting
not often met with in this generation
<a name="png.041" id="png.041"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">39</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of writers. It subscribed faithfully to the
great canons of publication&mdash;for instance,
it was written on &ldquo;one side only of
the paper&rdquo;; it was pinned together at the
&ldquo;left-hand top corner&rdquo;; no publisher had
ever found it necessary to gnash his teeth
because it reached him rolled instead of flat.</p>

<p>Yet behold the piteous history!</p>

<p>&ldquo;<cite>The Heirs of Tranby Chase</cite>, by <ins class="transcriber" title="Transcriber's note:
  Later we are told Miss Bibby's name is Agnes. This is the sole occurence of 'Katherine' in the text.">Katherine</ins>
J. Howard Bibby, Author of <cite>The Quest of
Guy Warburton</cite>, <cite>Through Darkness to Light</cite>,
or <cite>Lady Felicia&#8217;s Peril</cite>, etc., etc. Commenced
Jan. 1, 1895. Finished March 6,
1896. Copied out (three times) December,
1896. Submitted to Messrs. Kesteven, Sydney;
but they say they are publishing very
little at present, as times are depressed. To
James &amp; James, Melbourne; returned. And
unread, I am sure; the package had hardly
been touched. To Brown &amp; McMahon,
Melbourne. A most polite note, but they
do not care to publish so long a story. Shortened
it, and copied again (July, 1898). Sent
again to Brown &amp; McMahon. A printed
refusal: &lsquo;Regret cannot use.&rsquo; December,
1899, posted to London to Messrs. Frogget
&amp; Leach. No reply. Wrote five times,
but could not get packet back again, though
I enclosed postal note for return in case of
rejection. (Memo., never submit another MS.
to this firm.) Copied story again, and sent
<a name="png.042" id="png.042"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">40</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to Bailey &amp; Thompson, Paternoster Row.
An extremely kind and flattering reply;
their reader evidently thinks highly of the
story. Will be glad to publish it at my own
expense. Consulted Thomas. He thinks this
would be unwise, and will not allow me to
withdraw my savings from the bank for the
purpose until I have tried other firms. Sent
to Mr. Lance Rankin, the great author&#8217;s
agent, together with the five-guinea fee which
I found was necessary. April, 1902. Returned
by Mr. Rankin, who says he has submitted
it to fourteen different firms, but that
there is a great depression in the book market
at present. Possibly my plot is weak&mdash;must
try another story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so on, and so forth. The pluck of the
woman! The marvellous patience and endurance!
Did this extinguish her spirit?
No; she refreshed herself with reading tales
of other writers worsted in the fight&mdash;Gissing&#8217;s
<cite>New Grub Street</cite> afforded her the
maximum of melancholy satisfaction&mdash;and
then she fell to work on a new book. And
what the character of the new book was the
latest popular success decided. Among the
seven novels the trunk secreted was a historical
romance, a religious novel, a detective
tale, some &ldquo;bush studies,&rdquo; and a book of
political character.</p>

<p>Lynn disposed of a second saucerful of
<a name="png.043" id="png.043"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">41</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the banana compound that she called her
ice cream. It seemed to quicken her memory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hugh Rosskin is his name,&rdquo; she said
deliberately, &ldquo;and if Howie gets him it will
be a great big shame, &#8217;cause Larkin&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Miss Bibby was standing up, trembling
from head to foot, and with a spot of scarlet
colour in her cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hugh Kinross,&mdash;oh children, children&mdash;was
that really the name? Oh, Pauline, my
dear, my dear, try to think!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Pauline, &ldquo;Hugh Kinross&mdash;that
was it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hugh Kinross! Hugh Kinross! And
at &lsquo;Tenby&rsquo;!&rdquo; Miss Bibby looked as excited
as Muffie had done, when, going to feed her
guinea-pig the day before, she found five
little pinny gigs, as she tumultuously expressed
it, had been unexpectedly added unto
her stock.</p>

<p>Then she tried to pull herself swiftly together
and to look&mdash;as Miss Bibby should
look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have finished, children, you may
go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Yes, Anna, you may clear the
table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hurried away out of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s my belief she&#8217;s in love with &#8217;im, and
p&#8217;raps they&#8217;ve &#8217;ad a quarrel,&rdquo; said Anna,
who was aching in this quiet country place
for a spice of adventure. Miss Bibby had
<a name="png.044" id="png.044"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">42</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>not noticed that the girl had come into the
room at Max&#8217;s request with &ldquo;more lawberry
leserve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little girls looked at each other with
sparkling eyes. They loved a mystery as
much as Anna did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Pauline, &ldquo;won&#8217;t it be lovely?
Let&#8217;s go and watch at the gate.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">They flew off to stare at &ldquo;Tenby&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Tenby&rdquo;
with the local charwoman already
there, throwing up the windows and sweeping
away the dust of the winter.</p>

<h3 class="chap">THE FAMOUS NOVELIST</h3>


<p class="first"><span>It</span> was very early morning, seven o&#8217;clock
perhaps, and Hugh Kinross, the famous
novelist, sat in a camp chair at &ldquo;Tenby,&rdquo; his
feet on the verandah rail, and marvelled at
his fame.</p>

<p>It was not his custom to rise quite so early
to do this, but circumstances over which he
alone had any control, namely the mountain
fly, had driven him out of bed. There are
no mosquitoes on the mountains; consequently
many householders will not go to
the expense of mosquito nets.</p>

<p>But the mountain fly rises earlier than any
other fly extant, and the stranger who is
not provided with a guardian net, leaping
desperately up with it, has the early-rising
virtue forcibly thrust upon him.</p>

<p>Later in the day, his wrath forgotten, the
novelist writes to his city friends and boasts
of the light atmosphere of the mountains,
<a name="png.046" id="png.046"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">44</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>as if he had had something to do with the
manufacture of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I actually find myself rising at six,&rdquo; he
writes, &ldquo;simply to get out into the delicious
air.&rdquo; And not one mention does he make of
the debt he owes to the fly.</p>

<p>Hugh Kinross had been routed out at six and,
his first choler spent, was quite pleased with
himself. He discovered a path leading to a
gully, and in the gully a pool beneath a fall,
and here he had a circumscribed but delightful
swim. Then he climbed up the gully side
again, and the Lomaxes&#8217; home caught his eye,
and so pleased the artistic side of him that
he leaned over one of its hedges to gaze at
it.</p>

<p>And &ldquo;Greenways&rdquo; in the clear morning air,
nestling in its setting of tender green, splashed
everywhere with the light tints of flowers,&mdash;&ldquo;Greenways,&rdquo;
with its eyes turned to the mountain
where the marvellous morning lay in the
first fresh indescribable blueness that creeps
there after the pinks and purples and yellows
of the dawn,&mdash;&ldquo;Greenways,&rdquo; with a chimney
at the rear sending up the friendly line of its
earliest smoke, begot in him a vague emotion
that all the bricks and mortar in the city were
incapable of doing. He told himself that
he, too, wanted a home;&mdash;not the boarding-house
life that had been his before fame
swooped down on him, nor the more luxurious
<a name="png.047" id="png.047"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">45</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>club life that had followed, nor a holiday-month
like this present one, in a rented cottage
with his favourite sister for companion;
but a home&mdash;like &ldquo;Greenways&rdquo;&mdash;with a slender
woman in white, like the one there moving
about the paths. There was no question in his
mind but that she must be slender, for he
himself and his sister were both stout. How
Miss Bibby&#8217;s heart would have leapt could she
have known whose eyes were watching her
as she walked perseveringly up and down,
practising the early deep-breathing exercises
that she maintained were so essential to
health!</p>

<p>And it must be a home with signs of children&#8217;s
occupancy about&mdash;he was quite sure
of that. Max and Muffie would have been
amazed to know that the little red tricycle on
the verandah, and the doll&#8217;s perambulator
overturned on a path, were assisting a celebrated
man to this vague emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ridiculous!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&#8217;m hungry;
that&#8217;s what it is; this mountain air is doing
me good already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He crossed the road and went back to
&ldquo;Tenby,&rdquo; where his sister&#8217;s bedroom was
yet darkened, and the very servant still slept
serenely. He was good-hearted, and could
not bring himself to hammer on the doors;
but as he went to the pantry to find something
for himself, he concluded that they had fortified
<a name="png.048" id="png.048"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">46</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>themselves against the fly by drawing
the sheets over their heads.</p>

<p>The pantry and kitchen left him rueful.
Boxes of every size stood about in what
seemed to him the same wild confusion that
they had worn last night when they had been
tossed out of the carrier&#8217;s cart. He foraged
everywhere and could find no bread; in none
of the tins or jars in which he peered lurked
there any butter. Yet he realized that he
had no one to blame but himself for this confusion.
Matters had been beautifully arranged.
His married sister, Mrs. Gowan, had taken
&ldquo;Tenby&rdquo; for him, and seen to it that it was
spotlessly clean; his unmarried sister, Kate,
with an efficient servant, was to come up a
week ahead of himself to get everything in
perfect order and comfort for him, since he
was supposed to be overworked and in need
of a change.</p>

<p>And then, what must he do but upset everything!
He had told Kate he would come to
the station and see her comfortably off; but,
indeed, she had seen all the luggage into the
van, and the servant into another carriage,
and bought her own magazines and ensconced
herself comfortably in an empty first-class
compartment before there was a sign of him.
But then he came, and with a vengeance.
She saw him, red-faced with hurrying, come
striding along the platform, a Gladstone bag
<a name="png.049" id="png.049"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">47</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>in his hand, plainly looking for her. She
waved to him and he seized on a guard to
unlock her door for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ll be carried on,&mdash;quick, quick, get
out!&rdquo; she gasped, for the bell was ringing.</p>

<p>But he had dropped comfortably on to the
seat opposite to her, after putting his portmanteau
on the rack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m coming, too,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;re not,&rdquo; she cried,&mdash;&ldquo;you can&#8217;t,&mdash;I
shan&#8217;t be ready for you; there&#8217;ll be no breakfast.
Get out immediately, Hugh, and don&#8217;t
be so foolish.&rdquo; She actually dragged at his
coat to pull him up from his seat.</p>

<p>But then the train gave a jerk, and
she recognized the matter was out of her
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of all the wild doings!&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;you really might be twenty again, Hugh,
and going off to England at two days&#8217; notice
with your very socks undarned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I were,&rdquo; he said, and ruefully
smoothed a bald patch on the top of his
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;you don&#8217;t realize things a
bit. I haven&#8217;t ordered anything,&mdash;the very
beds aren&#8217;t made,&mdash;there won&#8217;t be a meal fit
to eat for at least two days.&rdquo; Kate looked as
nearly put out as a stout, bright-faced woman
of forty-five could look.</p>

<p><a name="png.050" id="png.050"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">48</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll sleep on a sofa,&rdquo; he said, good-humouredly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will have to be made up,&rdquo; she snapped,
or tried to snap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, I&#8217;ll sleep under it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what about breakfast? Well, you
will simply have to go to the hotel till I&#8217;m
ready for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll go to no hotel,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&#8217;m sick
of them. I&#8217;ll have half of your breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A boiled egg and bread, and the possibility
of no butter,&rdquo; she said scornfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A boiled egg and bread, and the possibility
of no butter be it,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what on earth induced you to do such
a mad thing?&rdquo; she persisted.</p>

<p>He rubbed his chin thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it was chiefly because the beggar
wouldn&#8217;t propose,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about, you mad
boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he was a decent
fellow&mdash;I&#8217;d quite spread myself on him, and
she was no end of a girl, quite the best I&#8217;ve
done. And I&#8217;d got him right up to the fence,
and I&#8217;m hanged if I could get him over. He
perorated, he posed like a shop-walker, you
could see him hanging limp like a broken
puppet, and me behind with beads on my forehead
uselessly jerking the wires.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.051" id="png.051"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">49</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Poor old boy!&rdquo; said Kate sympathetically.
&ldquo;Oh, he&#8217;ll do it beautifully when once
you&#8217;re on the mountains. Now I look at you
I can see you really are run down. I&#8217;ve been
planning how I will make you a comfortable
little study out of one of the bedrooms, and
fix up your writing-table under a window that
has a view, and give you a verandah to stalk
up and down on when the fine frenzies seize
you. But I don&#8217;t want you to come in for all
the confusion of the first day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;if you can stand it,
I ought to be able to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But that noble sentiment was uttered at
night, after a comfortable dinner at the
club, and with the grateful appreciation of
the sacrifice this loyal sister was making in
breaking all her engagements to come to
look after his welfare. It was before breakfast
now, a time when the sentiments are
absolutely raw, and the noblest mind is capable
of resentment when not fortified with food.
Hugh went out of the pantry and settled himself
gloomily upon a side verandah, uncertain
which to anathematize, the flies that had
broken in upon his slumbers, or the ones
that evidently were studiously refraining
from awakening his sister and her handmaid.</p>

<p>But after a time the peace of the perfect
morning soothed him, and he put his feet up on
<a name="png.052" id="png.052"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">50</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the verandah rail, and fell to marvelling at his
own fame.</p>

<p>Five years ago he had been quite unknown&mdash;a
struggling journalist savagely treated by
Fate. And for sheer need once of saner
employment for his leisure hours, he poured
out some of the bitterness that a severe
attack of indigestion had deposited on the
wholesome substratum of his nature in
perhaps as fierce a novel as had yet been
written.</p>

<p>Five publishers rejected it with their customary
regret; to the stereotyped refusal of
the sixth the reader added a few lines, saying
he had found much to admire in the work,
but that a gracious public full of nerves would
not stand so much cold water poured upon it.
The seventh firm to whom he submitted the
tale was on the verge of bankruptcy. Kinross
was absolutely startled when he received a
laconic note accepting his MS., and offering
a very fair royalty. He was not to know
that these publishers had taken it in the
spirit of a man who with six shillings for
his only capital puts five of them in a
sweep where the odds are a thousand to
one.</p>

<p>And then Fortune, who for more than
forty years had pretended she did not know
that there was any such person as Hugh
Kinross cumbering the globe, suddenly veered
<a name="png.053" id="png.053"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">51</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>round and smiled one of her most gracious
smiles upon him.</p>

<p>He fairly leapt into fame. The inscrutable
reading world, long bored almost to death
by a sameness of methods, actually rose up
and waved its hat at this savage treatment,
and demanded that he should continue so to
deal with it.</p>

<p>So Hugh, marvelling more than any one,
continued to &ldquo;lay about him with a knotted
stick&rdquo; as Kate, who had long typed his
stories unsuccessful and successful, expressed
it.</p>

<p>And he found himself wealthy, or at least
comfortable, beyond the hopes of his most
avaricious days, and famous beyond the wildest
dreams that had flamed up in him when
he had read his first journalese in print.</p>

<p>Even at forty-nine he had made no close
ties. One sister, Mrs. Gowan, was married
to a somewhat consequential brewer, who in
the journalistic days had rather patronized
Hugh. So there was no corner in that home
the author cared to accept for his own.</p>

<p>The other sister, Kate&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div>&ldquo;Fair, fat and fortiter in re,</div>
<div class="i4">And suave in manner&rdquo;&mdash;</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">had long since refused the brewer&#8217;s patronage
and pompous proposal that she should
<a name="png.054" id="png.054"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">52</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>make a home in his house, and in return act
as governess to his children. She had
thrown in her lot with Hugh, and was soon
making, as a typewriter who could be relied
upon for faithful work, a very comfortable
income. The brother and sister boarded
generally at the same house, and, absorbed
in their work, drifted over the borderland of
middle age together, and together lost their
respective waist lines. They were the best
of chums and respected each other&#8217;s weaknesses.
It was rather a trial to Hugh, perhaps,
that Kate, being fat, had taken ardently
to the bicycle and was therefore a joke among
onlookers. But seeing the extreme enjoyment
she got from her machine, and recognizing
that a healthy, hardworking woman,
without home or children, must break out
somewhere, he had never tried to make her
desist from her pleasure.</p>

<p>And Kate had to bear with Hugh.</p>

<p>He had a maddening habit of casting
forth the match with which he lighted his
pipe.</p>

<p>He would sit at a table surrounded with
match-holders of every variety&mdash;one Christmas
Kate had put six of the latest novelties
in this line in his sock&mdash;and he would strike a
light, and then thoughtlessly throw the
dead match either towards the window or
the fireplace.</p>

<p><a name="png.055" id="png.055"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">53</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>As he pointed out to Kate, the wish to do
well was plainly imbedded in his breast, or he
would simply fling the useless thing down at
his feet. Conscience was not deadened in him;
he was quite aware that matches should not
be casually strewn upon a carpet, and in his
most absent-minded moods he sent them in
the direction of those approved receptacles&mdash;the
window or fireplace. Let her blame
others if the window was closed&mdash;the sole
use of a window, as far as he could see, was
to throw matches through,&mdash;or if the fireplace
was ridiculously decorated with plants and
such foolishness, instead of holding its rightful
consuming element for used vestas.</p>

<p>When Fortune smiled so marvellously on
Hugh, one of the first things he did was to go
down to the city, and with his own hands
take down the strip of painted tin that, in
a building of offices, announced &ldquo;Miss Kinross,
Typist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was on the verge of following this act
by dropping the typewriter out of the window,
when Kate came in just in time to point out to
him that some one might be passing beneath,
and so receive a worse headache from the
thing than it had ever given her. She accepted,
as wholeheartedly as he gave it, an income
of two hundred a year from him. But she
clung to her old typewriter, and copied lovingly
all his stories for him.</p>

<p class="pgbrk"><a name="png.056" id="png.056"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">54</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>A deprecatory little cough just below him
took Hugh&#8217;s attention from himself, and the
place he had come so unexpectedly to occupy
in the economic scheme of Nature.</p>

 /></span>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3 class="chap">ANTE-PRANDIAL VISITORS</h3>


<p class="first"><span>He</span> looked and beheld a small maiden
clad in a holland frock, with a white
linen hat on the back of her gold-brown curls,
instead of being set in orthodox fashion upon
her head. Her white shoes and socks, fresh
with the morning, were a little reddened
with walking through the &ldquo;Tenby&rdquo; garden,
which, as Pauline had borne witness, contained
no grass whatever.</p>

<p>Just behind her was a small boy, sitting very
firmly on a little red tricycle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said Hugh; &ldquo;very glad to see you,
I&#8217;m sure. Friends who look you up in the low
ebb of the hours before breakfast are friends
indeed. Come along up, both of you, and tell
me your names.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Lynn stood loyal and steadfast at the
foot of the steps, while she put the first necessary
and searching question that was his due.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you had whooping cough?&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>Hugh clutched his hair. He told her he
<a name="png.058" id="png.058"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">56</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>was searching himself through all the crannies
of his boyhood years. Yes, he remembered.
He <em>had</em> undergone the affliction. There was
a birthday party away back twenty, thirty,
forty years through the mists, and <em>she</em> would
have been at it, with her hair done in two
little plaits and tied with blue ribbon. And
he had to stay away because he had whooping
cough.</p>

<p>Lynn looked very much relieved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a good thing!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is
very seldom you get it twice, so we shan&#8217;t hurt
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said gravely, looking down on
them, &ldquo;you really don&#8217;t look as if you would
hurt me&mdash;much. But won&#8217;t you come on
the verandah? And can the gentleman alight
by himself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lynn came up the steps a little shyly.</p>

<p>But Max, though he got off his tricycle,
looked a bit worried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won&#8217;t stand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will you
lend me your hank&#8217;fust to tie him to the post?
he&#8217;s a lood horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He means a blood horse,&rdquo; explained Lynn
in a low tone; &ldquo;he always pretends his
tricycle is a race-horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hugh lent the handkerchief&mdash;even offered
to assist in the tying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;d like to have given him a feed, poor old
Trike,&rdquo; said Max, &ldquo;only&mdash;&rdquo; and he looked
<a name="png.059" id="png.059"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">57</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>regretfully around the garden&mdash;&ldquo;you&#8217;ve no
grass, have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve no grass,&rdquo; said Hugh; &ldquo;but did you
never try him on white daisies? It wouldn&#8217;t
do, of course, to feed common horses on them,
but a blood steed like yours, why, it would
make his coat shine like varnish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Max&#8217;s eyes grew brilliant at the notion, and
he rattled his charger up to a bank near, that
was white with the flowers, and stuck the
thing&#8217;s head into it and fed him with handfuls
of petals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, why,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;he&#8217;s getting
shinier every minute&mdash;and his mane&#8217;s growing
longer and longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From that moment he regarded Hugh as
a man and a brother.</p>

<p>But Lynn had got to business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said when offered a chair&mdash;&ldquo;oh,
no, thank you, we can&#8217;t stay&mdash;Miss Bibby
doesn&#8217;t know we&#8217;ve come. But will you please
deal with Larkin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deal with Larkin?&rdquo; Hugh repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&#8217;s Octavius Smith, not Septimus,
and much better. Mamma deals with him,
and his bacon is only elevenpence, and he&#8217;ll
always bring your letters, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bacon!&rdquo; said Hugh, hungrily. &ldquo;I&#8217;d
deal with any one who has bacon if it is
fried and eggs are thrown in with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Lynn, &ldquo;he never throws them;
<a name="png.060" id="png.060"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">58</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>they&#8217;re always packed very carefully in sawdust.
And he doesn&#8217;t mind how often he
comes with the things you&#8217;ve forgotten, and
he gives you rides on his horse, and everything.
He&#8217;s really <em>much</em> better than that horrid
Howie, and he does so want to get a piano for
Blanch and Emma, and buy out Octavius
and Septimus, and put his mother in, because
she works too hard on the farm. You will
deal with him, won&#8217;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>By dint of a few questions Hugh put himself
in possession of the facts, and found out that
his visitors were also his nearest neighbours.
He discovered, too, that he would have been
called upon by the whole quartet, but that it
had been considered, in family conclave, that
four was perhaps too great a number for a
morning call. And further, it was necessary
for Miss Bibby to see some figures about the
garden. So the question was solved by drawing
lots, which fell, greatly to the disgust of
Pauline and Muffie, to Lynn and Max.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>know</em> you&#8217;ll go and spoil it all,&rdquo; said
Pauline. &ldquo;I could do it so much better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Lynn was on her mettle and fought hard
in Larkin&#8217;s cause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you what we&#8217;ll do,&rdquo; said Hugh,
struck with a brilliant idea, &ldquo;you shall come
with me, and we&#8217;ll go straight up to this
Larkin&#8217;s. You have made me feel that I can
exist no longer without some of the prime,
<a name="png.061" id="png.061"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">59</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>middle cuts of his bacon at elevenpence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Lynn, &ldquo;Miss Bibby!&rdquo; She
was torn between Larkin and duty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, we&#8217;ll go and ask permission
first,&rdquo; said Hugh; &ldquo;and we might leave Trike
behind, eh, Max? After a feed like that he&#8217;ll
want a rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Away they went out of the gate and across
the road.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby was down at the gate, fluttering
with vexation. She had just found out that
two of her naughty charges had actually dared
to go and trouble the sacred peace of the
famous novelist, and before he could have
breakfasted!</p>

<p class="pgbrk">She positively could hardly keep the tears
back.</p>

 /></span>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3 class="chap">A GROCERY ORDER</h3>


<p class="first"><span>Miss Bibby</span> had been awake nearly
all the night, her blood at fever heat.</p>

<p>Hugh Kinross a stone&#8217;s-throw away!
Hugh Kinross, the author of <cite>Liars All</cite>, and
<cite>In the Teeth of the World</cite>, and other books,
that had thrilled her and set her nerves
tingling as if a whip had been applied to her
back!</p>

<p>No book had ever so agitated her as <cite>Liars
All</cite>. And she had paid it the highest compliment
in her power&mdash;she had flung aside her
political novel, and the historical one that
she had been touching up, and the detective
tale that she had been copying afresh, and
she had started feverishly upon a short story
that she had entitled <cite>Hypocrites</cite>. And <em>she</em>
had tried desperately to &ldquo;lay about her with
a bludgeon,&rdquo; and say biting, savage things
of hypocritical human nature, and hold a
relentless mirror up to its little faults. Kinross
would have been convulsed could he
have seen it.</p>

<p><a name="png.063" id="png.063"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">61</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Miss Bibby lay in her quiet bed and illustrated
Kinross for herself, since she had never
been able to find a portrait of him in any
magazine. He was very tall, austere-looking,
very thin; the only smile that ever
crossed his face was a cynical, a sardonic one.
His hair and his eyes were black. He was
clean-shaven and his lip and chin were blue.</p>

<p>And she would meet him&mdash;she could hardly
help meeting him. Possibly she would never
get so far as knowing him to speak to, but
she would see his tall, spare figure moving
slowly about the verandah as he wove his
plots, and perhaps the shadow of his head
on the blind of a lighted window far into the
night.</p>

<p>The fever in her blood drove her from bed.
She got up and bathed, and dressed herself
with the punctilious care she always bestowed
upon her toilet.</p>

<p>Over the choice of her morning dress she
hesitated a moment. She wore dainty washing
blouses, and neatly-cut serge skirts as a
rule; but this morning something induced her
to don a limp lavender muslin that took all
the freshness from her cheeks.</p>

<p>Then she went out to the faithful performance
of her duties, which no amount of fever
in her blood could make her neglect. The
hot-water ordeal was gone through, the children
were turned out speckless from their
<a name="png.064" id="png.064"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">62</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>bedrooms, the bedclothes were put to air, and not
even her own &ldquo;deep-breathing exercises&rdquo;
were omitted.</p>

<p>But then she missed Max and Lynn. And
after a world of trouble dragged it from
Pauline that they had actually gone across
to &ldquo;Tenby&rdquo; to try to induce Hugh Kinross to
give his orders for bacon and such things
to Larkin.</p>

<p>Hugh Kinross and bacon! Miss Bibby
ran down to the gate almost choking with
agitation and distress.</p>

<p>There was a figure crossing the road, with
Lynn held by the hand, and the red tricycle,
and Max flanking it on the other side. It
was a figure of merely medium height, more
than a trifle inclined to stoutness, with an
ordinary kindly face and shrewd eyes.
He wore a white linen suit, creased all
over with bad packing, and a soft shirt
with a low collar. When he took off his old
Panama hat, Miss Bibby saw, quite with a
shock, the bald patch at the back of his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; he said pleasantly; &ldquo;my
little friend here tells me you are Miss Bibby.
May I introduce myself? My name is
Kinross. I have met the Judge on several
occasions and I think he will vouch for my
respectability. May I take these small ones
up the road with me? We are going in hot
pursuit of two of the world&#8217;s best things&mdash;eggs
<a name="png.065" id="png.065"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">63</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and bacon. I will return them safely&mdash;thank
you very much. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was all. Not another word, though
Miss Bibby, going over and over again in her
mind the great meeting, tried hard to imagine
that she had forgotten some notable thing
he had said. Then she began to torture
herself with fears that she had behaved
stupidly. The suddenness had been too much
for her; she could not recollect one solitary
thing that she had said except a fluttering
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; when he asked permission to
take the children with him. What must he
have thought of her?</p>

<p>Ah, if it could only happen over again when
she should have had time to collect her faculties
and make some brilliant and scathing
repartee as the women in his books so
frequently did. But then again, what chance
had his speech offered for repartee? What
kindling of conversation could there be when
the only tinder provided was&mdash;eggs and
bacon?</p>

<p>She worried herself to such a degree that
when breakfast-time came, her appetite,
usually small, had almost reached vanishing-point.</p>

<p>The cause of her flutterings was striding
along the red dusty road, Lynn and Max
having all they could do to keep up with him.</p>

<p>He, too, had had his moment of disappointment.
<a name="png.066" id="png.066"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">64</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Lynn had told him there was no
other lady in their house but Miss Bibby; and
then the figure that had given him some
pleasurable emotions an hour ago&mdash;the slender
white figure that had walked on the path
between the flowers&mdash;turned out on close view
to be merely a thin woman of almost forty, in
a floppy puce-coloured muslin gown.</p>

<p>And Lynn was unwittingly merciless to the
temporary occupant of her mother&#8217;s place.
When Kinross had asked her if it was Miss
Bibby who was up so early and walking
among the trees, she volunteered, in addition
to the affirmative&mdash;which would have been
quite enough&mdash;that she walked about like
that when she was doing some of her deep-breathing
exercises. And that after her deep-breathing
exercises she always skipped backwards
for five minutes, and after the skipping
she lay down flat on the floor and kept
lifting up her head in such a funny way.</p>

<p>And of course this led to an account of
Miss Bibby&#8217;s eccentricities of diet, of which
Kinross soon knew all that seemed worth
knowing. At first he had hardly listened
as the irrepressibles chattered away, or he
might have bidden them respect the lady&#8217;s
idiosyncrasies. But a sudden image confronted
him of the figure in limp muslin,
solemnly skipping for the good of her health,
and he gave a great roar of laughter and
<a name="png.067" id="png.067"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">65</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>vowed to himself he would use her for &ldquo;copy&rdquo;
some day.</p>

<p>But now they were at the shops and Lynn
and Max were greatly excited.</p>

<p>They pointed out the different places to
him.</p>

<p>This was Benson&#8217;s, and he made the most
<em>delicious</em> drop cakes that ever were; they
always bought some when they were going for
picnics, and gen&#8217;ally on a Saturday, when Anna
had no time to make cakes, they had them
again. Hugh was solemnly warned not to
be beguiled into dealing with Dunks. Dunks
did give, it was true, nine for sixpence; but
then Pauline had measured them once with
Miss Bibby&#8217;s tape measure&mdash;measured them
&ldquo;longways, and broadways, and fatways,&rdquo;
and Benson&#8217;s had been fully half an inch
superior.</p>

<p>These were the two photographers. It was
advisable to deal with this one, for he always
gave you the whole tray down to choose from
when you went to buy picture post-cards,
and the other man didn&#8217;t, &#8217;cause he was afraid
your hands were dirty. But they never
were when you went for a walk, only Max&#8217;s
sometimes, because he still fell down a lot
(this point Max contested hotly).</p>

<p>These were the two shoe-makers: if you
broke the strap of your sandals this one could
fix it best; but if you wore out your climbing
<a name="png.068" id="png.068"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">66</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>shoes, and wanted a new pair made, it was
advisable to patronize this one.</p>

<p>And <em>these</em> were the grocers. Poor old
Septimus Smith would have stirred uncomfortably
in the dreams that still held him,
could he have heard Lynn and Max vigorously
advising Burunda&#8217;s latest stranger never on
any pretence whatever to buy as much as half
a pound of butter at his establishment.</p>

<p>And Octavius, sleepily sweeping his shop
and doing the manifold duties of little Larkin,
who was fast nearing the poor selection for
his dearly-earned holiday,&mdash;Octavius would
himself have been amazed at the number of
good points his business had. His currants&mdash;how
<em>much</em> cleaner than the currants of Septimus,&mdash;his
bacon&mdash;words seemed inadequate
to describe his bacon. He gave you a whole
penny box of chocolates each when you went
with Anna to pay his bill. He saved you the
tinfoil from his tea-boxes and the lovely
paper ribbon off the boxes of raisins.</p>

<p>Hugh heard again about Blanche and
Emma and the piano, and the rapt vision of
the buying up of both the Smiths, and the
future conduct of one grocery business only by
a person of the name of Larkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not another word,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you have
more than convinced me that no one who
has any regard for his immortal soul would
deal anywhere but at Octavius Smith&#8217;s. Let
<a name="png.069" id="png.069"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">67</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>us go on and swell Larkin&#8217;s commission at
once. You are probably better up in housekeeping
than I am, Lynn,&mdash;if I forget any
item you must jog my memory. My sister
will be quite delighted that we have saved her
all this trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Octavius was speedily wide-awake.</p>

<p>He had always liked the Judge&#8217;s children,
and took a special interest in Lynn, who had
composed the following song for him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div>&ldquo;You must deal at the shop of Octave</div>
<div>Ius Smith if you&#8217;re anxious to save.</div>
<div>But into the small shop of Sept</div>
<div>We hope that you never have stept.&rdquo;</div>
</div>

<p>But this was beyond everything good and
thoughtful of the child. And as to Larkin,
who had obtained her interest so well&mdash;well,
the lad should have a &ldquo;thumping&rdquo; commission
on the order.</p>

<p>The old man&#8217;s hand began positively to
shake as he wrote and wrote at the order.</p>

<p>It was Lynn who suggested everything,
with Max occasionally coming in with a
brilliant thought like &ldquo;hundreds and lousands
of laspberry jam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for instance&mdash;soap. &ldquo;Yes, you will
need soap,&rdquo; Lynn said; &ldquo;how much? Oh, I
think you always order grocery things in half-dozens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half-dozens be it,&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>

<p><a name="png.070" id="png.070"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">68</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>&ldquo;Six bars of soap,&rdquo; wrote Octavius, who was
a little deaf, and had not heard the quantity
difficulty. &ldquo;Six pounds of sago, six tins of
curry-powder, y-y-yes, six jars of honey,
certainly, six tins of tongue, six tins of
asparagus, six pounds of pepper, six clothes
pegs. Bacon? Any favourite brand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all I&#8217;m particular about,&rdquo; said Hugh,
with a twinkle in his eye, &ldquo;is that it shall be
prime middle cut and elevenpence a pound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the very thing I make a speciality
of!&rdquo; cried the old man marvelling.</p>

<p>Finally the order was complete; it took
two pages of the order book. Octavius would
have to borrow Burunda&#8217;s one cart to deliver
so tremendous an order; the usual thing was
for Larkin to carry goods in a basket on
horseback.</p>

<p>He would have to go over to his brother
Septimus and borrow some things,&mdash;asparagus,
for instance; he never kept more than
two tins at a time of so expensive an article.
And pepper&mdash;his whole stock of pepper at
present was but three pounds!</p>

<p>He bowed his customers out, rubbing his
hands together, praising the day, the view&mdash;everything.
Some enormously wealthy friend
of the Judge, without a doubt. Possibly the
Premier from some other State&mdash;yes, most
likely a Premier&mdash;who else could want six
tins of tongue? Doubtless he was going to
<a name="png.071" id="png.071"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">69</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>entertain the Ministers at a picnic at the
waterfall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Premier&rdquo; came back after he had
gone a step or two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just wrap me up
some of that bacon and a few eggs, and I&#8217;ll
take them with me now. We&#8217;ve nothing
for breakfast at our house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half-way down the hill again, Lynn, speechless
with the thought of telling Pauline and
Muffie about her brilliant success, Max, a
little depressed&mdash;he could never walk before
breakfast without feeling very large and
hollow inside&mdash;Hugh, blandly holding to him
the parcel of eggs and bacon, met an unexpected
sight&mdash;Kate toiling along up the
steep grade on her bicycle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He-he-he!&rdquo; giggled Lynn; &ldquo;look at that
funny fat woman on a bicycle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s only a lack bicycle,&rdquo; said Max critically,
&ldquo;mine&#8217;s led.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The funny fat woman got off in a most agile
fashion when they came alongside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My <em>dear</em> Hugh!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I imagined
you still sound asleep. What on earth
are you after now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eggs and bacon,&rdquo; said Hugh promptly,
&ldquo;and you can just come home and fry them
for me. Exercise must wait for a more
suitable time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exercise!&rdquo; panted the lady indignantly,
<a name="png.072" id="png.072"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">70</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>&ldquo;why, I was just killing myself to get up to a
store, and buy some butter for your breakfast,
I had quite forgotten to bring any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have ordered it,&rdquo; said Hugh&mdash;&ldquo;six
pounds of it. My little lady friend here
informs me that it is the correct thing to
order groceries in half-dozens. I like doing
the correct thing, though a doubt did cross
my mind as to the advisability of laying in
six pounds of pepper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Six pounds of pepper! Oh, Hugh, you
are joking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked helplessly at Lynn.</p>

<p>But Lynn&#8217;s sensitive little face was scarlet;
she had called this bicycle lady &ldquo;a funny fat
woman,&rdquo; and here she was a friend of this very
nice man&#8217;s.</p>

<p>She did not know whether to gasp out
an apology or remain silent. The latter
course commended itself, however, to her,
as it ever does to children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&#8217;t mean to say you have given a
grocery order without consulting me, Hugh?&rdquo;
insisted the lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a little one to see us over to-day,&rdquo;
said Hugh. &ldquo;Half a dozen ox-tongues, half
a dozen bars of soap&mdash;I forget the rest. I
thought they would come in useful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, man,&rdquo; cried Kate, &ldquo;the kitchen is
full of packing-cases of groceries that I
brought from town. You don&#8217;t imagine I
<a name="png.073" id="png.073"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">71</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>was going to let you run the risk of inferior
things from a country store!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is prime middle cut, I assure you,&rdquo;
said Hugh seriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going up to cancel your ridiculous
order,&rdquo; said Kate determinedly, preparing
to mount. &ldquo;I shall explain to the storekeeper
that you are not responsible for your actions.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;You are going home to fry my bacon,&rdquo;
said Hugh, as he whirled her bicycle round;
&ldquo;if you don&#8217;t I swear I&#8217;ll sit down here and
eat it raw.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="chap">LETTERS TO A MOTHER</h3>


<p class="first"><span>One</span> morning, not long after this, there
came to Miss Bibby at &ldquo;Greenways&rdquo;
a letter from Thomas Bibby in the city.</p>

<p>Thomas was the sole male member of the
family of Bibby, and was a hard-headed young
clerk in the commercial department of a big
evening newspaper. He had been brought up
by his sisters;&mdash;there were three more Misses
Bibby scattered about the State, teaching,
or in similar positions of trust to the &ldquo;Greenways&rdquo;
Miss Bibby. And they were all inclined
to be literary. Clara Bibby wrote verse;
if you happened to be a reader of obscure
country newspapers you would frequently
come across a poem entitled <cite>Australia&mdash;my
Country</cite>, or <cite>Wattle Blossom</cite>, with
the signature &ldquo;Clara L. C. Bibby&rdquo; beneath it.
Alice, the quietest, gentlest little person in
the world, wrote vehement articles in the
suburban <cite>Woman&#8217;s Political Organ</cite>. And
Grace had actually brought out a book. A
<a name="png.075" id="png.075"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">73</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>publisher had been touched at her despair
when he handed her back her useless MS.,
and suggested she should compile a cookery
book for him, which after a little time of
dignified sulking she did; and the book came
out and, there being room for it, had a most
successful sale. And Grace, quite pleased
and surprised, positively taught herself to
cook from it, and found the subject so full of
interest that she abandoned her heroines and
started a second volume of <cite>Cookery Hints for
Busy Housewives</cite>. But it galled the pride of
Agnes, the &ldquo;Greenways&rdquo; Miss Bibby, and
Clara, the poetess, and Alice, the <cite>Woman&#8217;s
Voice</cite>, that she signed it with her own name.
They were confronted everywhere with <cite>Bibby&#8217;s
Cookery Book.</cite></p>

<p>Thomas, after he had finished being brought
up by these ladies, surprised every one by his
faculty for business. They took him in his
eighteenth year to the editor of an evening
paper who was known to them, and begged
that he should be received into the office to
gain an insight into literary life, as they
hoped in a few more years he would become
a novelist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose I&#8217;ll have to give you a trial,&rdquo;
growled the editor to the sulky-looking
novelist-to-be, when the ladies had fluttered
away. &ldquo;Here you are, here&#8217;s a bank manager
made a mess of his accounts&mdash;no roguery
<a name="png.076" id="png.076"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">74</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>about it, simple confusion, and he goes and
shoots himself and his wife&mdash;can you turn
that into a novel of two hundred words?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I can&#8217;t,&rdquo; said Thomas, who hated all
things literary. Then his sulky look vanished
and his eyes brightened. &ldquo;But I tell
you what I <em>could</em> do&mdash;go and straighten out
the poor chap&#8217;s accounts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said the editor, &ldquo;you&#8217;d better
go downstairs, my fine fellow, and ask Mr.
Gates to give you a stool in the office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Thomas became a valued clerk in
the counting-house. And presently when a
foolish, feminine speculation swept away
the income of the sisters, Thomas established
himself as guardian of their bank-books,
and general business man of the
family.</p>

<p>The sisters, though a little money was
still left, decided to take situations as governesses
and companions, telling each other it
would widen their outlook on life, and give
them experiences that might prove invaluable
in their literary work. Judge and Mrs.
Lomax felt themselves fortunate when Miss
Agnes Bibby, with such unquestionable credentials,
appeared in answer to their advertisement
for some one to take charge of their
family during their absence.</p>

<p>And now came a letter from Thomas in the
city to Agnes at &ldquo;Greenways&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>

<div class="epistle">

<p><a name="png.077" id="png.077"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">75</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear old Ag.</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&#8217;s a chance for you if you can only
take it. We&#8217;ve just heard that writing chap,
Hugh Kinross, has gone to Burunda for a
holiday. The beggar has dodged every attempt
at an interview, though we and every other
paper, for the matter of that, have lain for
him in every possible place. Well, I was
talking to the editor the other day&mdash;he&#8217;s
no end affable to me, and often has a chat&mdash;and
I happened to say you were at Burunda.
And he said, &lsquo;Burunda! why that&#8217;s where
Kinross is taking a holiday. Tell her to get
any interesting information she can about
him, and I&#8217;ll pay her well for it. If she can
manage an interview&mdash;a woman can rush
in sometimes where a man fears to tread&mdash;I&#8217;ll
give her six guineas. Yes, and take one
of the stories with which she is always bombarding
me, hanged if I won&#8217;t!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can see it&#8217;s worth trying for, old
girl. Six guineas down for the interview,
and say another four for a short story, not
counting getting into print at last. Go in
and win, say I. I&#8217;m sending with this an
English mag. or two, with interviews in to
show you the style of thing they need.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can easily find him out; he&#8217;s sure to
be at one of the hotels. Dog him on a walk
some day, and then when you&#8217;ve got him
cornered somewhere where he can&#8217;t escape,
<a name="png.078" id="png.078"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">76</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>whip out your note-book and make him hold
up his arms. Butter him up a bit, and he&#8217;ll
give in; he&#8217;s not been famous long enough
not to feel inclined to purr if you rub him the
right way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&#8217;s written two or three books; <cite>Liars
All</cite> is one of them. They&#8217;re not in your line,
of course, but I must say they&#8217;re not at all
bad. Well, go in and win.</p>

<p class="rt4">&ldquo;Yours,</p>
<p class="rt2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Tom</span>.</p>

<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />&ldquo;PS.&mdash;I banked thirteen pounds six to-day
for Grace&mdash;more royalties from the <cite>Cookery
Book.</cite> Why don&#8217;t you try something in the
same line? <cite>Poultry Keeping for Retrenched
Incomes</cite>, for instance; it would sell like penny
ice creams on a heat-wave day.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p class="pgbrk">Miss Bibby, after reading this letter for the
third time that day, hastened into the dining-room
where the children were awaiting her, a
red spot on her cheek, and a hole burning inside
her sleeve near her elbow, where, being pocketless
as any modern woman, she had tucked
the letter.</p>


<p class="illus pgbrk"><a name="png.079" id="png.079"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">76a</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span><img src="images/illus-079.jpg"
 width="400" height="643" alt="" title="" /><br
 />&ldquo;She exacted half-an-hour a day at the piano, from each
of the little girls.&rdquo;</p>


<p>She kept her thoughts away from it only
by desperate expedients, such as sternly
reminding herself that her time at present
was paid for by Judge Lomax, and therefore
belonged absolutely to him. Later in the
<a name="png.081" id="png.081"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">77</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>day it would be a different matter, but now to
her duties,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pauline, Lynn, get out your pens this
moment;&mdash;no, Muffie, you must write in
pencil, you have spoiled the cloth with the
ink you have spilled;&mdash;yes, yes, in a minute;
Max, you sit here, dear, on the nice high chair,
and then you can reach beautifully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Max firmly refused the nice high chair,
which he long had considered beneath the
dignity of a man with a pocket, and had to
be established as usual on two or three fat
music books placed on a &ldquo;grown-up&rdquo; chair.</p>

<p>There were no regular lessons during the
holidays, but Mrs. Lomax having said vaguely,
at leaving, that she hoped the little girls
would not have quite forgotten their scales,
and how to write and read, before the governess
returned, Miss Bibby had considered it
her duty to see to these things.</p>

<p>So she exacted half an hour a day at the
piano from each of the little girls, and faithfully
sat beside them saying: &ldquo;One, two,
three, four, don&#8217;t droop your wrists, Lynn;
one, two, three, four, count, Pauline; one, two,
three, four, thumb under, Muffie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she established two letter hours a week,
and saw to it that the children wrote to their
parents in their best hand for one page,
though she allowed a &ldquo;go-as-you-please&rdquo; for
the other pages, judging that that would give
<a name="png.082" id="png.082"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">78</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>most pleasure across the wash of the Pacific
seas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dearest Mummie and Dad,&rdquo; wrote
Pauline this afternoon, &ldquo;I played my Serenade
through yesterday without one single solitary
mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she looked up with trouble in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Bibby,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you know just
where you turn over and the chords begin,
are you <em>sure</em> I didn&#8217;t play D flat there, instead
of D natural?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Bibby started guiltily; as silence had
settled slowly down over the room her thoughts
began to drop nearer and nearer to her elbow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t remember, dear,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;didn&#8217;t
I praise you&mdash;didn&#8217;t we say you could tell
mother that you had it quite correct at last?
Yes, I remember quite well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pauline sighed. There was no help for her
spiritual difficulty here. That doubtful D
flat had made her toss restlessly for half an
hour before she slept last night. She was
consumed by the desire to write the glorious
news to her mother, and even Miss Bibby,
exigent Miss Bibby, had said the piece was
perfect. But Pauline herself had a lurking,
miserable doubt in her mind; she seemed to
recollect just one mistake, just one tiresome
finger jumping up to a black note, when it
should have played a white one with a slur.
She stared wretchedly at the written statement
<a name="png.083" id="png.083"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">79</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>before her. Suppose it were not
true&mdash;think of writing a lie, an actual lie
to mother! But, indeed, if she really knew
for certain that she had played D flat she
would not dream of writing so. It was the
doubt that tormented. She had better not
write so certainly&mdash;yes, she would add something
that would leave the question more
open. &ldquo;Perhaps&rdquo; was the word, of course,&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps&rdquo;
excused many, many things.
She read over the beginning once more,
imagining it to be her mother&#8217;s eye perusing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dearest Mummie and Dad,&mdash;I played
my Serenade through this morning without
one single solitary mistake perhaps.&rsquo;&rdquo; Oh,
how the wretched word pulled one up,
tarnished the brilliant achievement!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pauline, you cannot have finished; sit
down,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby.</p>

<p>Pauline shook her head gloomily. &ldquo;I
can&#8217;t write yet,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I think I&#8217;ll just
go and play it over once more to be certain.
That might have been D flat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby excusingly, for the
Serenade was long, like the lay <ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original includes extraneous opening double quote">of</ins> the Last
Minstrel. &ldquo;Mother won&#8217;t mind, dear&mdash;just
say you played it very well, and I was much
pleased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Pauline shook her head wretchedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&#8217;ll play it again,&rdquo; she said, and
<a name="png.084" id="png.084"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">80</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>crossed over to the piano with melancholy
eyes.</p>

<p>Lynn was wrestling with her first page.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dearie mother, we don&#8217;t cough so mush&rsquo;
(how do you spell cough, Miss Bibby?
There&#8217;s a horrid g or q in it somewhere, I
know)&mdash;&lsquo;I don&#8217;t smudg so mush.&rsquo; I wish
(Oh, dear, you said we oughtn&#8217;t to say we
wished she&#8217;d come back, didn&#8217;t you, Miss
Bibby, cause she might stop enjoying herself?
What else could I put after &lsquo;I wish&rsquo;? I&#8217;ve
got that written<ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original has the closing quote before the parenthesis">).&rdquo;</ins></p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose you say you wish you could write
better,&rdquo; suggested Miss Bibby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that will have to do,&rdquo; said the
little girl sadly. &ldquo;No, I&#8217;ll tell you, &#8217;cause I
don&#8217;t <em>much</em> want to write better, I&#8217;ll say I wish
words would ryum better. Look at beauty,
nothing will go with it but duty, and duty is
such a ugly word in a song, isn&#8217;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I think it is a beautiful word,&rdquo; said
Miss Bibby; she expected herself to say this,
and was not disappointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&#8217;t,&rdquo; sighed Lynn. &ldquo;I could
have made a lovely song this morning. It
began&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div>&lsquo;Oh, the bush is full of beauty,</div>
<div class="i4">And the flowers are full of love,&rsquo;</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but I couldn&#8217;t go any farther, &#8217;cause there was
nothing to ryum but that horrid duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.085" id="png.085"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">81</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;I think you could have made it very
pretty, dear, with that word,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby.
&ldquo;And say rhyme, Lynn, not ryum. You
could have said,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div>&lsquo;Oh, the bush is full of beauty,</div>
<div class="i4">And the flowers are full of love,</div>
<div>And if we do our duty,</div>
<div class="i4">We&mdash;&mdash;we&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;something like that, you know, dear.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i2">&ldquo;&lsquo;We&#8217;ll soon get up above,&rsquo;&rdquo;</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">finished Lynn discontentedly. &ldquo;No, I didn&#8217;t
want it to go like that; it was just going
to be a springy sort of a song, with wild
birds in it, not a lessony sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, get on with your letter, my dear,&rdquo;
said Miss Bibby, who was often helpless
before the fine instinct for the value of words
with which Lynn had been gifted.</p>

<p>So Lynn continued in a cramped hand,
&ldquo;I wish there were more nice words&mdash;duty
won&#8217;t do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a sentence calculated to puzzle
even parents intelligent as Judge and Mrs.
Lomax imagined themselves.</p>

<p>Then the child turned over to her &ldquo;free&rdquo;
sheet, on which she might write and spell as
she pleased, and gazed at it wistfully.</p>

<p>Oh, to purr out her little heart upon it
<a name="png.086" id="png.086"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">82</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>so that the mother so far away might hear
her speaking, whispering, just as if she were
cuddled up in the dear arms!</p>

<p>What a tragic thing this was in her hand,
this red pen with the end sucked nearly white,
so powerful, so powerless!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; she wrote, and then covered a
line or two with black crosses, that meant
a passion of kisses. Oh, to catch at all the
words that were surging in her heaving little
breast, and to force them down on the white
sheet, and to send them away red-hot across
the sea!</p>

<p>She dipped wildly in the ink, she breathed
hard and held the pen in almost a convulsive
way. But the pitiful steel thing only spluttered,
and left a few lines of black scribble.
Could the mother understand that? Ah,
perhaps, perhaps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hop you are well, from Lynn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so concluded the bi-weekly letter, with
a big tear as usual, for Lynn simply could
not write to mother without crying a little,
though for the rest of the time she was a
merry little grig.</p>

<p>Muffie was still blissfully untroubled by the
need of orthography, and scribbled steadily
over four pages, her lips moving all the time
to such tune as &ldquo;&lsquo;so we went down the gully
and ferns, such a lot. And I got the best of all,
and it&#8217;s under the house for you in a tin from
<a name="png.087" id="png.087"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">83</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Anna, and all of it&#8217;s for you in the bushhouse
at our proper house and daddie.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a time the Serenade began to get
upon the nerves of all the room.</p>

<p>Eleven times did poor Pauline attack it
and eleven times did she have a breakdown.
It was not always the D flat that caused the
downfall, though Miss Bibby found herself
listening with nerves a-stretch every time the
difficult bar approached. And she felt inclined
to cry with thankfulness everytime the
child went smoothly past. But then just as
surely as her nervous tension released itself,
and she began to comfort herself that the
concluding page could not fail to go well, a
stumble, a slip, a despairing cry from the piano
stool, and the whole performance began again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, make her stop, Miss Bibby,&rdquo; implored
Muffie; &ldquo;she intrupts me dreadf&#8217;lly, and I&#8217;m
in the middle of telling about the fat lady
that rides on a bicycle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make her stop,&rdquo; said Max, she &ldquo;intlups
me worse. I&#8217;ll never get my letter done.&rdquo;
Max, except for a wavy line or two in red
chalk generally confined his correspondence
to enclosing tangible sections of things in
which he was interested at the time. To-day
he had stuffed into his envelope a clipping
from the tail of Larkin&#8217;s horse, one of the
white daisies Trike was being nourished upon,
some shavings of coloured chalks from a box
<a name="png.088" id="png.088"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">84</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>on which he had just expended his final penny,
and a few currants from his last drop cake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m getting all my chalks mixed up with
her intlupting me,&rdquo; he complained, looking
angrily towards the piano where the devoted
Pauline still battled madly with the Serenade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pauline, my dear child, I shall go out
of my senses if you play the thing again,&rdquo;
Miss Bibby said desperately, as Pauline
for the twelfth time began the clashing
chords that opened the piece, and served as
contrast for the gentler music of the Serenade
itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve&mdash;I&#8217;ve <em>sworn</em> to myself to get it right,&rdquo;
said Pauline wildly. Her lips were quivering,
her eyes were full of tears, her very hands
were shaking with weariness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&#8217;t swear,&rdquo; began Miss Bibby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The butcher does,&rdquo; volunteered Max.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I mean it is wrong to bind oneself by
a promise one may not be able to keep,&rdquo; Miss
Bibby added hastily. &ldquo;And you are not to
talk to the butcher, Max. Shut the piano
now, Pauline, and another time when you are
quite calm&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve got it w-w-written,&rdquo; sobbed Pauline,
fighting with the keys through a mist of tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can easily start another letter,&rdquo;
said Miss Bibby distractedly; &ldquo;don&#8217;t mention
your music this time&mdash;your mother won&#8217;t
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.089" id="png.089"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">85</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;No, I can&#8217;t stop; I can&#8217;t stop,&rdquo; wailed
Pauline, playing on as if under a spell.</p>

<p>At this point Anna stalked into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which I&#8217;m quite aware it isn&#8217;t my place,
Miss Bibby; but I&#8217;m here to look after the
children as well as you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and them
down with whooping cough that dreadful
they can&#8217;t eat potatoes, and getting punished
like this till the very kettle in the kitchen is
ready to scream, and the Missus don&#8217;t believe
in punishing, no, she don&#8217;t, and it&#8217;s a good
deal longer I&#8217;ve lived in the fambly than some
people, and knows the ways better, and the
tears streaming down the poor child&#8217;s face like
you never saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pauline had quivered once or twice during
this heated speech, but as it finished she
crashed on to D flat yet again, fell off her
stool on to the floor, and rolled about screaming
with laughter.</p>

<p>Even Miss Bibby was forced to smile a
little, for Anna was plainly suffering keenly,
and had bottled it up for some time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean well, Anna,&rdquo; she said quietly,
&ldquo;even if you don&#8217;t express yourself well.
You can put on your hat and take the children
to the waterfall; it will do you all good,
for it will be cool down there. I will go to the
post, lock the side door, and put the key under
the mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In ten minutes &ldquo;Greenways&rdquo; lay still and
<a name="png.090" id="png.090"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">86</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>peaceful once more among its trees, as if no
Serenade had ever troubled its repose. The
children were scampering down the gully with
Anna following warily, certain she heard a
snake at every step.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">And Miss Bibby, the letters under her arm,
was buttoning her gloves inside the gate, and
settling her veil for the walk up to the township.</p>

<h3 class="chap">ACROSS THE RUBICON</h3>


<p class="first"><span>But</span> Larkin came along, Larkin, his auriferous
hair glinting in the sun, Larkin, with
his empty grocery basket swung on his rein
arm, and a sheaf of papers under the other.</p>

<p>Larkin came along. And the whole course
of Miss Bibby&#8217;s life was thereby changed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, ma&#8217;am,&rdquo; said the boy;
&ldquo;anything I can fetch yer down fer tea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll post yer letters for you,&rdquo; continued
the youth; &ldquo;I&#8217;m going straight back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Bibby reflected a moment.</p>

<p>It would certainly save her some time if he
did so, and she had nothing now to do until
tea&mdash;yes, it would give her a chance to read
Thomas&#8217;s letter once more, and consider
things quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a bit &#8217;ot, walking,&rdquo; Larkin said encouragingly.
She handed him the letters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put them in your pocket,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
be sure to post them very carefully.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.092" id="png.092"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">88</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;I posts a good few &#8217;ereabouts, and no
complaints,&rdquo; smiled Larkin. &ldquo;So nothing&#8217;s
wanted?&rdquo; There was a note of sadness in
the last question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps I could do with a tin of
sponge fingers,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby softening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Bibby, ma&mdash;am, twopence,&rdquo;
said Larkin, digging his heel into his
horse and flying off. Twopence represented
his commission; of course, without knowing
it, he was falling into the habit of calculating
it aloud.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby walked slowly back along the
path, and with one slender white hand drew
out again from her sleeve the agitating letter
from Thomas. Again she read it steadily.
Again she walked back to the gate, thinking
deeply.</p>

<p>Actually at the gate she lifted her eyes and
looked, with a quivering sigh at &ldquo;Tenby,&rdquo;
blinking shadeless in the afternoon sun.</p>

<p>The thing was impossible, of course. Not
for anything in the world could she march up
to that dread door and calmly propose to
interview its almost sacred tenant.</p>

<p>Yet what a chance it was&mdash;in very truth the
chance of all her lifetime! To have a story
in print and paid for, she had craved this
during all the long years that separate fourteen
from thirty-six.</p>

<p>Again she walked towards the house, again
<a name="png.093" id="png.093"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">89</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>back, this time along a higher path, to look
yet again across the front hedge to the fateful
cottage opposite.</p>

<p>And this time the higher position disclosed
a view of the cottage not obtainable from the
big gate. And this view included a little
side verandah. And the little side verandah
included Miss Kinross, her ample proportions
disposed upon a small rocking-chair,&mdash;Miss
Kinross amiably engaged in eating bananas,
and reading a penny woman&#8217;s paper in the
hope of finding therein some new dish with
which to tempt Hugh&#8217;s appetite.</p>

<p>How very ordinary she looked, how very
good-natured and stout!</p>

<p>Sudden and brilliant ideas came more seldom
to Miss Bibby than to the children she was
&ldquo;care-taking.&rdquo; But undoubtedly one seized
her now. The author himself was plainly
either out, pacing a mountain top as he worked
out his ideas, or else shut up securely in his
study.</p>

<p>What if one threw oneself on the mercy of
the stout, kindly-faced lady over there and
implored her aid in the delicate task!</p>

<p>Miss Bibby did what she had probably
never done since she was twenty&mdash;acted upon
a sudden impulse instead of weighing and
considering her action for days and weeks.
She found herself moving across the road,
lifting the latch of &ldquo;Tenby&#8217;s&rdquo; gate, walking,
<a name="png.094" id="png.094"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">90</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>not to the front door and ringing the bell in a
respectable fashion, but forcing her trembling
knees to carry her directly round to the side
verandah.</p>

<p>Miss Kinross looked annoyed; few of us
like to be caught by a stranger when we are
tilted well back in a rocking-chair eating
bananas in our fingers instead of upon a fruit
plate and with orthodox knife and fork.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby, &ldquo;pray don&#8217;t be
vexed; pray forgive me, it must seem unpardonably
rude, but I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She put her hand
to her throat a moment, too agitated to continue.</p>

<p>Miss Kinross laid down her banana skin and
rose to her feet, rapidly disarmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Miss Bibby, is it not?&rdquo; she said,
holding her hand out with her most pleasant
smile. &ldquo;My brother told me your name; now
where will you sit, do you like a low chair?
try this one. It is kind of you to look us up
so early.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Bibby sat down still struggling with
her agitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;I&mdash;not a visit&mdash;should not
presume&mdash;an author&#8217;s time&mdash;I came simply
to ask a favour of you&mdash;so great a favour I&mdash;simply
feel now I am actually here that it is
impossible to ask it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you must think better of that feeling,
for I really love any one to ask me a favour.
<a name="png.095" id="png.095"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">91</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>I believe all stout people are the same, a little
weakness of the flesh, you know&rdquo;; and Miss
Kinross gave her visitor a smile so winning,
so encouraging, that Miss Bibby&#8217;s heart began
to beat in its normal fashion again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But first,&rdquo; continued Miss Kinross, &ldquo;we
will have some tea. Now don&#8217;t say you have
had yours, if there is one thing I dislike
it is drinking my afternoon tea in solitary
state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No, Miss Bibby had not had tea; Thomas&#8217;s
letter and the Serenade together had put even
her severe afternoon drink of plain cold water
out of her head.</p>

<p>But when Miss Kinross made a favour of
it like that, how could she refuse to receive
a cup when the maid carried out the tray?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said to the query about sugar,
and &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to milk. And &ldquo;Yes, fairly
strong,&rdquo; when asked how she liked it. No one
would have dreamed it was more than six
years since her last cup.</p>

<p>Possibly it was the unaccustomed stimulant
that loosened her tongue; possibly it was
the warm womanly sympathy that shone in
her hostess&#8217;s brown eyes&mdash;eyes that had made
more than one person declare that Kate
Kinross was absolutely beautiful, despite her
avoirdupois. At any rate, Miss Bibby found
herself pouring out all the story of her
thwarted life, all the long tragedy of the
<a name="png.096" id="png.096"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">92</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>seven declined novels in the trunk across
the road.</p>

<p>Miss Kinross gave eager sympathy. That
was nothing, nothing; many authors now
famous had been declined again and again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seven times?&rdquo; asked Miss Bibby, with
gentle mournfulness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Miss Kinross stoutly.
&ldquo;Why, look at Hugh, it is his favourite boast
that there isn&#8217;t a publisher in England who
has not refused him at one time or another;
nor one who wouldn&#8217;t be glad to accept him
to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Kinross&mdash;refused!&rdquo; echoed Miss
Bibby. Her world seemed in need of reconstruction
for a minute. Then a strange
warmth and comfort gathered about her poor
heart. This made the author less terribly
aloof, less altogether impossible to question
if she should have the happiness of obtaining
an interview.</p>

<p>She put her request at last very timidly
to her new friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think he would give me an interview&mdash;just
a very, very short one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But now Kate Kinross was perturbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; she said (all women she
liked were &ldquo;dear girls&rdquo; to Kate), &ldquo;I simply
dare not ask him. He has stood out against
it so persistently all these five years. He
simply hates publicity; he says all he asks is
<a name="png.097" id="png.097"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">93</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to do his work, to do it as he likes, and to go
his own way as unmolested and as privately
as a bricklayer does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But just a very, very short one,&rdquo; pleaded
Miss Bibby. She went on to tell Kate about
Thomas&#8217;s letter, the editor&#8217;s offer, this chance
of a lifetime for herself.</p>

<p>Kate almost groaned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five years have I kept them off him,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;five whole years, and not one
interviewer have I even allowed to get across
the doorway! And you would have me plot
against his peace like this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Bibby urged no more, just sat still and
swallowed heroically once or twice, and then
said smilingly that it &ldquo;didn&#8217;t matter at
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Kate&#8217;s keen eyes were on her all the
time. Something about this slender woman
with the grey, half-startled eyes, and the soft
mouth that quivered so easily, and the soft,
thin cheek where the pink pulsed to and
fro as rapidly as in a young girl&#8217;s, touched
her curiously.</p>

<p>She stood up at last and put a hand on her
visitor&#8217;s shoulder in a hearty, encouraging
way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;come along, you
shall have your chance. He had his, I&#8217;ll
remind him of that. He will probably never
forgive me, but I will risk that. Come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.098" id="png.098"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">94</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;But not now&mdash;you don&#8217;t mean now?&rdquo;
gasped Miss Bibby, shrinking back in actual
alarm, for her hostess seemed seeking to pilot
her into the house. It would certainly take
a week or two to persuade the author, she
counted, and she herself would consequently
have that length of time in which to screw up
her courage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly now,&rdquo; said Miss Kinross, &ldquo;this
minute. Why not? He&#8217;s only in that room
across the hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh,&rdquo; gasped Miss Bibby, &ldquo;I&mdash;I must
have time&mdash;I&mdash;I daren&#8217;t&mdash;Oh, Oh&mdash;don&#8217;t
knock at the door&mdash;for Heaven&#8217;s sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kate laughed and drew back one moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he&#8217;s not in the
least brutal, as he seems from his books. You
couldn&#8217;t meet with a more harmless man
if you hunted for a year. Don&#8217;t you be
alarmed&mdash;why, you silly girl, you are actually
trembling! He is nearly as stout as I am,
and much more good-natured, and you&#8217;re
not afraid of me. Now, come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She opened a door without knocking and
put in her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; she said, in as bland a tone as
she could call up, &ldquo;I have brought a lady to
interview you for the <cite>Evening Mail</cite>. I have
assured her you will not object. Well, I
shall see you again in half an hour, Miss
Bibby.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk"><a name="png.099" id="png.099"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">95</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>And Miss Bibby felt herself pushed gently
into the study of Hugh Kinross, and all
retreat cut off behind her by the silent closing
of the door.</p>

<h3 class="chap">THE INTERVIEW FOR THE &ldquo;EVENING MAIL&rdquo;</h3>


<p class="first"><span>Kate</span> could hardly have chosen a more inopportune
moment. The hero, who had
troubled Hugh&#8217;s repose in the moist atmosphere
of the city, persisted in behaving in an
untoward fashion, even when translated to
an altitude of three thousand feet or so. He
still perorated, still posed like a shop-walker,
still behaved like a puppet, with its pulling
strings in plainest evidence.</p>

<p>It was a mercilessly hot afternoon. All
over the mountains the tourists were asking
themselves in bitterness of spirit why they
had left their comfortable homes in the city
to subject themselves to weather like this.
They all had the feeling of being wronged
out of their money; the hotel-keepers, the
house-agents, had lured them here under
false pretences, and positively deserved punishment.</p>

<p>The sweat of heat and mental exertion
poured down Hugh&#8217;s face. He had followed
<a name="png.101" id="png.101"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">97</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>his usual plan of work this year, that of drifting
pleasantly along for nine months, jotting
down a few notes, and writing a chapter
now and again; and then pulling himself
sharply together, and trying to work like a
horse, and get all his ideas reduced to paper,
corrected, re-written, and made ready for
Kate to type in three months. Every New
Year&#8217;s Day he sat with Kate and mapped
out a plan of work for the fresh year, that was
to be utterly dissimilar to this reprehensible
practice. Sometimes they got paper, and
planned out each month&#8217;s work, so many
chapters to the month; it was surprising
how simple it all looked, put down like that.
For instance, one book a year, when a year
consisted of three hundred and sixty-five
days, was not too much to expect from a
moderately active man in full possession of
his health and faculties. One book a year
represented say, thirty chapters, sixty or
seventy thousand words. Seventy thousand
words, divided by three hundred and sixty-five
days, represented less than two hundred
words a day. It looked like child&#8217;s play&mdash;on
the sheet of paper. It fairly astonished
Hugh when he saw the whole question of his
authorship thus reduced to its simple factors
in black and white. Kate had typed the
remarkable memorandum for him last year,
and pasted it on a card, so that he might prop
<a name="png.102" id="png.102"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">98</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>it up before him on his desk as a constant
reminder.</p>

<p>Two hundred words a day! He used to
spend much of the early part of January leaning
back in his chair, happily planning out
the accomplishment of two or three books
which had long been in his head, but which
want of time had hitherto prevented from
getting as far as his writing-block. Yes,
he determined (in January) that it was
more than possible to have the whole three
finished by next December; he was not
married, his time was his own, he could
order his days as he pleased, and turn night
into day, and day into night, exactly when
he chose. Why, when the good moods
came, did he not write five thousand words
a day, easily, eagerly! And this steady
writing of a couple of hundred words a day
would bring the good mood often, no doubt.</p>

<p>Yes, he would finish the three books this
year&mdash;the subjects were all to his hand&mdash;and
possibly the play he had had tucked away
in his mind so many years. And some verse,
too&mdash;the luxury of verse was very dear to him.</p>

<p>Brave January with the sun of resolution
flaming high in the sky!</p>

<p>It was December now.</p>

<p>The poet might have as truly spoken of the
<em>facilis descensus</em> to December as to the torrid
region he mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="png.103" id="png.103"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">99</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>It was December, and Hugh&#8217;s first book
still wanted forty thousand words to complete
it. The other two works, the play,
the verses, were still in the pale nimbus that
ever plays tantalizingly around an author&#8217;s
desk.</p>

<p>It was December and the publisher was
clamouring for copy. In the proud insolence
begot of January&#8217;s shining possibilities and
Kate&#8217;s neat memorandum, Hugh had promised
his book by August.</p>

<p>And the long-suffering, kindly publisher,
sympathetic over an author&#8217;s mood, had
refrained from overmuch pressing of his
claim for three months. But it was December
now and he was growing restive; the
MS. had to be typed, had to waste five
weeks at sea, to be read in London, to be
placed as advantageously as possible for
serial rights in various countries, to be illustrated,
to be printed, proofs had to be sent
out for correction, to be returned, ten more
weeks had to be lost at sea, and yet the book
be published in the sacred season of autumn,
nine short months hence.</p>

<p>The publisher was restive and Hugh desperate.</p>

<p>He had sworn to himself this afternoon
nearly as fiercely as Pauline had that he
would not leave the room until he &ldquo;got it
right.&rdquo; Pauline was granted the relief of
<a name="png.104" id="png.104"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">100</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>tears. Hugh could only give vent to his
tumult of mind by tearing off his collar and
hurling it into one corner of the room, peeling
off his coat and flinging it under his table, and
kicking off his white canvas shoes. These
last he had purchased from one of the shoe-makers
in the township only this morning,
having neglected to put any footgear at all
in his portmanteau. And being only two
and elevenpence&mdash;none better were kept in
stock&mdash;the shoes were badly cut and pinched
him atrociously.</p>

<p>One at present reposed, sole upwards, on a
chair where it had alighted after a vigorous
aërial flight, and the other stood its ground
in the middle of the floor.</p>

<p>And this was the manner of author Miss
Bibby found herself suddenly shut up with
for an interview destined for the <cite>Evening Mail!</cite></p>

<p>Hugh spun round in his chair at Kate&#8217;s
bland voice. He probably imagined he was
in his revolving-chair at home, but he was
not, and the frail article beneath him, unused
to gyration upon one leg, gave way
instantly and all but precipitated him at
full length before his visitor.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">Max, who an hour before had impugned
the butcher&#8217;s impurity of language, would have
found that in some respects a butcher and
an author were men and brothers.</p>


<p class="illus pgbrk"><a name="png.105" id="png.105"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">100a</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span><img src="images/illus-105.jpg"
 width="400" height="637" alt="" title="" /><br
 />&ldquo;Hugh spun round in his chair at Kate&#8217;s bland voice&rdquo;</p>


<p>There was only one word; but the vigorous
<a name="png.107" id="png.107"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">101</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>deliverance of it made Miss Bibby catch
her breath and clasp her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have startled you, madam,&rdquo; said Hugh,
facing the &ldquo;limp lavender lady&rdquo; as he had
called her to Kate; &ldquo;and I ought to apologize,
I am aware, but I don&#8217;t. I would have
apologized had I been betrayed to it in a
drawing-room. But this is my work-room,
<em>where I see nobody</em>.&rdquo; The last four words
were almost thundered.</p>

<p>Agnes Bibby was praying&mdash;actually praying
for courage. Her throat was working,
her grey eyes had their most startled look.
She was twisting her hands nervously together.</p>

<p>Hugh was not in the least conscience-stricken
at her evident lack of composure.</p>

<p>He seriously considered for one second the
expediency of repeating the word, and adding
a few others to it, and so scaring the lavender
lady out of his room and out of his life for ever.</p>

<p>But then he noticed she was actually trembling,
and though his savage impulses were
still well to the fore, he dragged up a chair
and said &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Bibby sat down uncertainly, still
gazing at him as if half expecting he might
pounce on her and eat her at any second.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now what incredible thing was it I
heard my sister say?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;Miss Kinross&mdash;was good enough
to try to help me to&mdash;an interview&mdash;a very
<a name="png.108" id="png.108"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">102</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>short one&mdash;with you,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby,
gathering breath and strength with the opening
of her mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An interview! And my sister&mdash;my
sister, Kate Kinross&mdash;is party to it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was willing to help another woman,&rdquo;
said Miss Bibby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;I see, the two of you
have plotted together to entrap a defenceless
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Bibby ventured on a faint smile, for
the author was certainly smiling now. How
was she to know, as Kate might have done,
that it was his dangerous smile?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope you are going to forgive me,
and grant my request,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if I don&#8217;t&mdash;if contumaciously I
refuse?&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>

<p>Surely Miss Bibby&#8217;s prayer for courage
was answered. She looked him gently in
the eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should try again,&rdquo; she said; and when
he laughed at her fluttering audacity, she
actually added, &ldquo;and still again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see, I see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&#8217;m plainly powerless.
Well, &lsquo;if &#8217;twere done at all, then &#8217;twere
well it were done quickly.&rsquo; Fire away, Miss
Bibby; just regard me as a lamb led to the
slaughter.&rdquo; There was a twinkle in his eye
so demoniac that Kate would have been
truly alarmed.</p>

<p><a name="png.109" id="png.109"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">103</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>But now Miss Bibby was at a disadvantage.
&ldquo;I&mdash;unfortunately I have come unprepared,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I did not expect to get the interview
for quite a week. I brought no pencil
and paper, and I might forget something
you say.&rdquo; She looked distressedly at his
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&#8217;t mention a trifle like that,&rdquo; said
Hugh urbanely; &ldquo;permit me to lend you my
fountain-pen&rdquo;&mdash;he handed it to her&mdash;&ldquo;and,
this writing-block, is that sufficient paper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, quite,&rdquo; she said gratefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; said Hugh, and he leaned
back in his chair and lowered his eyelids over
his wicked eyes, &ldquo;I will answer any question
you like to put to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How good you are!&rdquo; breathed Miss Bibby.</p>

<p>Then there was a dead silence in the little
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hugh, opening his eyes,
&ldquo;why don&#8217;t you begin? It cannot be that
compunction has suddenly seized you, I
fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman&#8217;s grey eyes wore their startled
look again, there was the pink flag of distress
on her cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I cannot think of any of the questions
I should ask,&rdquo; she said chokingly. &ldquo;I
meant to have carefully studied other interviews;
I did not expect to have it so suddenly.
Oh, what can you think of me for wasting
<a name="png.110" id="png.110"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">104</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>your time like this?&rdquo; She made a motion as
if to rise and go. But Hugh waved her back
to her chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; he said with smoothest courtesy,
&ldquo;I may be able to help you. It would
be a pity to let such trifles prevent you from
earning money. I presume you will be paid
for this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby, &ldquo;I am offered
six guineas for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! And you need the money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am not actually in want of it,&rdquo;
said Miss Bibby, &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you could do with it, I see; most
people can, can&#8217;t they? Well, let us get on.
You want to know all about my private life,
don&#8217;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby, shocked. &ldquo;I
should not like to intrude like that. Just
simple questions, I&mdash;I think they generally
ask where you were born.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Hugh; &ldquo;you haven&#8217;t
studied the question, it&#8217;s plain. The public
don&#8217;t care a hang nowadays where or how or
when a man&#8217;s born. What they want to do
is to lift the curtain suddenly from his home
and see him going through the common round
of his daily life. By George, wouldn&#8217;t they
like to catch him beating his wife! A glimpse
like that would make an interviewer&#8217;s fortune.
&#8217;Pon my soul, Miss Bibby, I&#8217;d give you the
<a name="png.111" id="png.111"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">105</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>chance&mdash;you are so indefatigable&mdash;if I had
such a thing as a wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Bibby laughed nervously,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think they like to know about an
author&#8217;s methods of work,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you
would be so very kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, certainly,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;I
rather pride myself upon my methods, now
you come to mention it. I don&#8217;t believe
there&#8217;s an author extant or underground with
similar. See this card?&rdquo; He rummaged on
his table for Kate&#8217;s neatly-typed little memorandum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Miss Bibby breathlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s my daily allowance, two hundred
words. Couldn&#8217;t sleep a wink if it were a
hundred and ninety-nine. Pull myself up
sharp even in the middle of a speech if I find
I&#8217;m likely to make it two hundred and one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How very interesting!&rdquo; said Miss Bibby,
scribbling hard. &ldquo;A whole day, polishing
two hundred words! No wonder the critics
speak of your crystal style, Mr. Kinross. It
reminds me of what I have read of Flaubert&#8217;s
methods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Hugh dreamily, &ldquo;I have a
few other little methods of work, though so
trivial and so essentially personal I don&#8217;t
know whether you would find them worth
mentioning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, anything, anything, Mr. Kinross, if
<a name="png.112" id="png.112"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">106</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>you will be so kind,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby enthusiastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hugh, looking pensively
around his work-room, &ldquo;I am a man of rather
curious habits. I may say my habits have
become part of my nature. Certain spells are
necessary to get me into proper vein for my
two hundred words. For instance, my collar&mdash;you
may have been surprised to find me
collarless, Miss Bibby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Bibby hastily expressed the sentiment
that nothing he could do could surprise her;
then saw the difficulties of the sentence, and
grappled hard with it to reduce it to a polite
form that should express the fact that a great
author is above all the petty bonds that bind
the rest of the world, and must be expected
to act accordingly.</p>

<p>But Hugh was evidently not listening to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most authors, I believe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when
working, wear their collars in the place
intended by nature&mdash;or should I say the
manufacturers?&mdash;namely, around their neck.
I cannot write one word until it is in the
corner of the room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Bibby made a note of the curious fact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, mark you,&rdquo; said Hugh impressively,
&ldquo;it has to be the left-hand corner, facing the
door, or the charm won&#8217;t work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How <em>very</em> strange!&rdquo; murmured Miss Bibby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then my shoes,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;There are
<a name="png.113" id="png.113"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">107</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>authors, doubtless, who can write with these
in their customary place&mdash;upon their feet.
I cannot. My soul is too large, too chaotic.
But perhaps you are not interested in men&#8217;s
shoes, Miss Bibby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was regarding sadly the one of his own
that stood in the middle of the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, an author&#8217;s shoes,&rdquo; murmured Miss
Bibby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, curious as it may seem to you,
that, too, has become one of my spells,&rdquo; said
Hugh, &ldquo;my feet unfettered beneath my table.
One shoe a little pointed to the right in the
middle of the room; another, sole upwards,
on a chair three and three-quarter feet distant
from its fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Absolutely remarkable!&rdquo; gasped Miss
Bibby. She looked at him, a pencil poised a
little hesitatingly. Was this thing possible?
Was the great author then not quite, quite&mdash;&mdash;she
hardly liked, even in thought, to use the
word sane?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; said Hugh diffidently,
&ldquo;the fact may not seem worth mentioning
in your article, but it is my experience that
there is nothing which so endears a celebrity
to his public as his little eccentricities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby,
&ldquo;perfectly right, and indeed you are very,
very good to make them known to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all, not at all,&rdquo; said Hugh
<a name="png.114" id="png.114"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">108</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>graciously. &ldquo;Anything else? I like to read
myself, in these interviews, what time a
writer gets up and goes to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby, &ldquo;that will be
very interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hugh, carefully fitting the
finger tips of one hand on to the tips of the
other, &ldquo;I rise at a quarter to five, winter
and summer, and get a cool two thousand off
my chest while yet my fellow men are buried
in slumber. And&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby, &ldquo;I don&#8217;t
quite follow&mdash;two thousand what, Mr.
Kinross?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Words, of course,&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;B&mdash;b&mdash;but,&rdquo; hesitated Miss Bibby,
&ldquo;I thought you said two hundred a day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hugh blinked a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have
doubtless heard me called a stylist. Every
one of those two hundred words I erase five
to ten times, polishing, substituting, seeking
to express myself better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Bibby was writing fluently again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the author, &ldquo;occupies me
until half-past six, when I take three baths,
one hot, one cold, one&mdash;like the church of
the Laodiceans&mdash;neither. This stimulates
me marvellously.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scratch, scratch went the fountain-pen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After this,&rdquo; said the author, &ldquo;I walk ten
<a name="png.115" id="png.115"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">109</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>miles along a level road, and three through a
hilly country, during the last mile of the latter
practising the deep-breathing exercises so
highly recommended by the medical faculty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scratch, scratch, the pink cheek flag deepening
with pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On my return I go through a short course
of exercises for the muscles, answer a few
letters while I am cooling down, and then
breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be eleven o&#8217;clock by then,&rdquo; ventured
Miss Bibby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eleven o&#8217;clock it is,&rdquo; said Hugh, after a
moment&#8217;s consideration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And for breakfast,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby.
&ldquo;Do you&mdash;do you eat ordinary things? It
would be so interesting to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hugh was about to instance eggs and bacon
in exaggerated quantities, when he realized
that they were much too gross for such a
paper. So he shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I attribute my perfect health and clear
and active brain solely to the cautions I
observe with my diet,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;No
meat, no drinking at meals, no bread, no
puddings. There are excellent substitutes,&rdquo;
he picked up negligently from his desk a
small packet that had been sent&mdash;an advertisement
sample&mdash;to him by the morning&#8217;s
post, and had not yet been disposed of.</p>

<p><a name="png.116" id="png.116"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">110</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Miss Bibby wrote on, glowing with fellow-feeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In conclusion,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I am a strict
teetotaler, and I never smoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then it occurred to him &ldquo;Greenways&rdquo;
might have seen the red end of a cigar on
the &ldquo;Tenby&rdquo; verandah, and he added,
&ldquo;except an occasional cigar under medical
orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rose from his chair and gazed pensively
at his black socked feet.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby fluttered up at once, handed
back his pen, and hurriedly tore off from the
block her last written sheet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can never, never thank you enough,&rdquo;
she said, and held out to him a hand that
somehow pleased him, and made him compunctious
at the same time&mdash;such a white,
slender, gentlewoman&#8217;s hand it was.</p>

<p>But then he remembered his hero had not
yet proposed, and assuredly would not to-day
after such an interruption. He told himself
that she had deserved all she got, and that
she would, at all events, earn the six guineas
she was so eager about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&#8217;t mention it,&rdquo; he said gallantly,
and turned her over to Kate, who was just
coming along to satisfy herself that actual
murder had not been committed.</p>

<p>She fluttered back one moment, however,
just as he was closing the door.</p>

<p><a name="png.117" id="png.117"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">111</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;I believe interviews have to be signed
as authentic by their subject, have they not?&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;forgive me for troubling you
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, have they?&rdquo; he said. His fountain-pen
was in his hand. &ldquo;Where shall I put
the signature? I suppose you will copy all
this out again; suppose I write on this blank
slip?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do nicely,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guarantee this to be an authentic
interview, Hugh Kinross, his mark,&rdquo; he
scrawled lazily across the page.</p>

<p>When he took his seat at the tea-table that
night Kate came behind him and kissed the
top of his head, an unusual mark of affection,
for they were an undemonstrative couple in
general.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear old Hughie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have
given delight to more than one person.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;I believe I have, K,&rdquo; he said genially.</p>

<h3 class="chap">ANNA ENJOYS ILL-HEALTH</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="uc"><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;A</span>nna,&rdquo;</span> said Miss Bibby, with happy
eyes the next morning, &ldquo;I am going
to take a whole holiday to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&#8217; about time,&rdquo; said Anna, &ldquo;I&#8217;ve been
wonderin&#8217; how long you could keep it up,
Miss Bibby. You&#8217;ve not had one yet, and
me half a dozen. I don&#8217;t have half as much
to do with those childerun as you, but if I
didn&#8217;t get away from them sometimes I&#8217;d get
hysterics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure they are very good children&mdash;wonderfully
good, Anna,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, they&#8217;re good enough,&rdquo; said
Anna, &ldquo;but so uncommon lively. And talk!
They keeps it up, one after the other, and
sometimes all four at a time, till your head
spins round like a top. I got quite giddy
goin&#8217; down to the waterfall with them yesterday,
and it wasn&#8217;t the steps, neither, it was
just their tongues going at it, clackerty-clack
all the time. What time will you be back,
Miss Bibby?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.119" id="png.119"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">113</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby, &ldquo;I should not
think of going <em>away</em> for my holiday, Anna.
Mrs. Lomax knows nothing would make me
leave the children so long, while she is so far
away. But since she begged me to take a
day a week to myself, I am going to shut
myself in my room to-day. I have very
important work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Working him a pair of slippers, I&#8217;ll
undertake,&rdquo; ran Anna&#8217;s thoughts. But aloud
she said, &ldquo;Yes, you do, Miss Bibby. I&#8217;ll keep
them youngsters away from you; you get a
good rest while you&#8217;re about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heartiness in her tone was due to the
fact that she was about to ask for an extra
special holiday for herself in a day or two
to attend the Mountain Bakers&#8217; picnic at a
distant waterfall.</p>

<p>So Miss Bibby disappeared into her room
for the day, after having written down the
children&#8217;s meals in her painstaking fashion
on the kitchen slate, and given the tradesmen&#8217;s
orders, and seen the children happily
engaged in their favourite game of Swiss
Family Robinson.</p>

<p>Anna sighed with relief; gentle as Miss
Bibby was she had a way of keeping people
up to the mark, and on a warm day like this,
a well-executed policy of &ldquo;letting things slip&rdquo;
appealed to the imagination.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby came back a moment.</p>

<p><a name="png.120" id="png.120"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">114</span><span class="ns">]
 /></span>&ldquo;Anna,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have neglected to
give Master Max and Miss Lynn their medicine,
will you call them in and give it to
them? I do not want to waste time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anna undertook the commission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m thinking of; I
forgot my own doses,&rdquo; she muttered as she
went to the dining-room for the bottles.
Max had been ordered a pleasant preparation
of malt to fortify his little system during his
convalescence, and Lynn an iron tonic. The
other two were making such excellent recoveries
nothing was needed.</p>

<p>Anna reached the two bottles from the
cupboard, measured out with a steady hand
a tablespoon of the malt, and swallowed it,
then followed it by a teaspoonful of Lynn&#8217;s
iron. She looked at herself in the sideboard
mirror as she did so. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m
looking any better,&rdquo; she said mournfully.</p>

<p>Anna keenly enjoyed the worst of health.</p>

<p>She was an an&aelig;mic-looking girl with a
pasty complexion, and hair several shades
too light to correspond comfortably with it.</p>

<p>Ill-health was the only subject in life in
which she took a genuine interest.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby supposed Anna quite a reader,
so often did she find her deep in a paper, and
so the girl was&mdash;of medical advertisements.
The marvellous recoveries of persons like
Mrs. Joseph Huggins, of Arabella Street,
<a name="png.121" id="png.121"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">115</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Chippendale, who had been given up by six
leading doctors after suffering from a blood-curdling
list of ailments for seventeen years,
and had been cured after taking one bottle,
were a source of unfailing interest to Anna.</p>

<p>And never did an advertisement offer free
a sample bottle of any drug, no matter for
what purpose, but Anna sent instantly and
claimed it.</p>

<p>It needed nothing but the announcement
on Max&#8217;s malt bottle of its tissue-building
qualities, and its power of restoring the waste
of nature in the human frame, for the girl at
once privately to take a course of the same
treatment and, as the chemist&#8217;s bill might
have testified, from the same bottle.</p>

<p>Similarly with Lynn&#8217;s tonic; the accompanying
pamphlet said something about its
invigorating powers and the restoration of
red corpuscles to the blood, so Anna at once
prescribed it for herself also&mdash;out of Lynn&#8217;s
bottle.</p>

<p>And Miss Bibby&#8217;s Health Foods that that
lady paid for out of her slender purse&mdash;Anna
determined that it was these things
that gave the temporary head of the house
that curiously delicate clear skin of hers; so
being by no means satisfied with her own
complexion, she consistently assisted herself
to a small quantity of each, without, it
need hardly be stated, foregoing any of her
<a name="png.122" id="png.122"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">116</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>hearty meals at the kitchen table with Blake
the gardener.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby had certainly been vaguely
surprised at first at the rapid lowering both
of the children&#8217;s medicines and her own tins,
but never dreaming of suspecting so unusual
a cause, soon grew entirely accustomed to it,
and imagined it was the normal consumption.</p>

<p>Her own constitution thus fortified, this
morning Anna called loudly through the
window for Max and Lynn to come in this
instant and take their &ldquo;medsuns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Max came eagerly; he was so fond of his
treacley spoonful it was a marvel he had not
of his own accord jogged some one&#8217;s memory
and insisted upon the omission being rectified.</p>

<p>But Lynn&#8217;s tonic embittered life for her
for a considerable time before taking, as well
as for several minutes afterwards, until a long
drink and a chocolate removed the nauseous
taste.</p>

<p>She was playing this morning, before
Anna&#8217;s call, in a mood of chastened joy.</p>

<p>Her conscience was always a prickly little
affair, and forced her to confess to her sins
almost before she had committed them.
But she told herself this morning that it was
certainly no business of hers to point out
to Miss Bibby Miss Bibby&#8217;s forgetfulness.
And she was just comfortably settled up in
<a name="png.123" id="png.123"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">117</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the big quince tree as Fritz, in &ldquo;Falconhurst,&rdquo;
when that soul-vexing cry about
&ldquo;medsun&rdquo; shrilled through a window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8217;Tend you don&#8217;t hear; it&#8217;s only Anna,&rdquo;
said Pauline in swift sympathy.</p>

<p>Lynn flattened her body along a bough
and drew up a possibly betraying leg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I show?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>Paul shook her head, and moved with Muffie
hastily away from the tree and began to
run towards Anna, who, failing to obtain her
quarry with a shout, was now seen rapidly
coming to the Island of the Robinson family,
late of Switzerland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anna,&rdquo; shouted Pauline, one of the most
resourceful young people in the world, &ldquo;have
you seen Lynn anywhere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anna pulled up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&#8217;t,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you <em>sure</em> she&#8217;s not in the house?&rdquo;
persisted Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she is and heard me calling, I&#8217;ll give
it to her, or my name&#8217;s not Anna,&rdquo; said that
maiden irately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think she can have gone again
over to &lsquo;Tenby&rsquo;?&rdquo; pursued Pauline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s it&mdash;that&#8217;s what&#8217;s got her,&rdquo; said
Anna; &ldquo;and fine and mad Miss Bibby will
be with her, going worrying that book-man
again. Well, I&#8217;m not going trapesing over
there in this sun, but I&#8217;ll make her take two
<a name="png.124" id="png.124"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">118</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>doses at lunch if I have to put it down her
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with this frightful threat Anna returned
to the house.</p>

<p>Poor Fritz nearly fell out of &ldquo;Falconhurst&rdquo;
in his agitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think I&#8217;ll go up and take it, Paul,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;two doses together would be too
awful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes grew round with horror at the
mere thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could shut your teeth hard, after
the first spoonful,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;and refuse,
firmly refuse more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could spit it out,&rdquo; said Muffie eagerly,
&ldquo;like when they gave me the castor-oil; and
it was the last in the bottle, so they couldn&#8217;t
give me any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there are <em>gallons</em> more in my bottle,&rdquo;
Lynn said dolefully, &ldquo;and you heard
what she said about putting it down my
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Pauline, the judicial
look of her father in her eyes, &ldquo;that&#8217;s just
talk about putting it down our backs. I
thought it all out that day Muffie ate the
green peach. You know Miss Bibby said
then she&#8217;d put it down her back&mdash;the castor-oil,
you know. Well, if I&#8217;d been Muffie I&#8217;d
just have said, &lsquo;All right, do.&rsquo; Do you think
they would have done so, and got her clothes
<a name="png.125" id="png.125"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">119</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>all nasty and greasy? Not they, they think
far too much of clothes. But even if they
<em>had</em>&mdash;well, it might have been a bit sticky,
but it would be better than taking stuff
like that down your mouth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was marvellous perspicacity of
thought; Lynn looked admiringly down at
her sister, and Muffie stood, with her mouth
open, digesting this freshly-minted fact, and
making clear resolutions for all future consequences
of green peaches.</p>

<p>They fell to playing again, Lynn remaining
in the tree, however. Mrs. Robinson now
engaged in sewing skin coats with a porcupine
needle and flax, since the more active
part of Fritz, shooting and shouting down
below, was fraught with too much danger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&#8217;t make Tentholm, &#8217;less I have the
diny-room tablecloth,&rdquo; said Muffie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, go and get it,&rdquo; said Pauline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Muffie, making a line for
it, then calling back, just as a little sop to
duty, &ldquo;she said we weren&#8217;t to, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run up and ask her,&rdquo; said Lynn, a law-abiding
little person so long as the iron did
not enter her soul or body.</p>

<p>Muffie dashed into Miss Bibby&#8217;s bedroom
after the briefest knock, and made her
request.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; murmured Miss Bibby, looking
up with bright eyes from some writing she
<a name="png.126" id="png.126"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">120</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>was engaged upon, &ldquo;just this once, dear,
but be careful not to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Muffie had sprung away again, and
what she had to avoid with the cloth, whether
tearing it into holes, or getting mud on it,
or losing it, or wetting it, she did not wait to
hear. It is possible Miss Bibby did not even
finish the sentence&mdash;her eyes looked absent-minded
enough for such a lapse.</p>

<p>Muffie went gleefully back to Robinson
Island, the art-green serge trailing behind
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can have it, we can have it!&rdquo; she
announced gleefully, &ldquo;only we&#8217;re to be careful
not to&mdash;come on, fasten it on to the
sticks, Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Bibby had reached the chronicle of
Hugh Kinross&#8217;s &ldquo;endearing little eccentricities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A small pile of neatly written sheets lay
to the right of her. In front of her lay more
sheets, scored through, corrected, polished,
until Flaubert himself would have been
satisfied with the labour bestowed.</p>

<p>She had worked steadily through the
night, the silent night in the hills, her lamp
the only household eye still open in miles of
black slumbering country.</p>

<p>At three o&#8217;clock she had flung herself down
and snatched a few hours&#8217; sleep, but by seven
she was up again, the same quivering excitement
<a name="png.127" id="png.127"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">121</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>in her veins. A little more polishing,
then a fair copy in her very neatest hand,
and she might bear it up to the four o&#8217;clock
post, and send it flying forward to the <cite>Evening
Mail.</cite></p>

<p>The envelope that would hold it would hold
also her destiny, she told herself. This was
the most important crisis of her life; she
had travelled nearly forty years&mdash;thirty-six
to be exact&mdash;along a road of life, not
rough and stony as many a road is, but just
dull and level and monotonous and dusty,
as are so many excellent highways. But
now she stood at two crossroads, and saw
stretching before her one in no wise different
from that she had traversed so long, and the
other a glittering tempting path springing
joyously up a high hill, on the top of which,
in the shade of laurel trees, sat at ease the
whole goodly company of great authors.
She fancied they were beckoning to her; she
heard sweet voices from them throughout
that feverish night&mdash;&ldquo;Come up higher, Agnes
Bibby,&rdquo; they were saying.</p>

<p>The interview was the first step along this
second path. The story, already promised
space for, would be the second. And then,
from out the bitter gloom of the trunk, the
novels would emerge, one after the other, the
world graciously holding out its hand for
them.</p>

<p><a name="png.128" id="png.128"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">122</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Miss Bibby,&rdquo; said a mournful voice at
the door, &ldquo;Miss Bibby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; sighed Miss Bibby, &ldquo;what is
it now, Max?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Max entered with a wool door-mat depending
from his collar and just reaching his shoes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no tail,&rdquo; he said, his lip drooping,
&ldquo;an&#8217; Paul an&#8217; Muff&#8217;s got late big long ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; said Miss Bibby, after a frantic
glance round her own apartment in search of
an appendix, &ldquo;I have nothing that would
do, Max. Do run away, darling. Pretend
you&#8217;ve got a tail, that is just as good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Max gulped threateningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laindeers have leal tails,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Again a frantic glance around. &ldquo;Would
a towel do if I pinned it on, dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Max shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the lawning-loom lere&#8217;s a tail on the
curtains,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it&#8217;s showd on tight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, ask Paul, ask Anna, ask some one
else to look for something for you; but you
mustn&#8217;t come to me, darling, this is Miss
Bibby&#8217;s holiday, you don&#8217;t want to spoil it
for her, do you?&rdquo; Miss Bibby looked at
him beseechingly.</p>

<p>But Max&#8217;s lip drooped lower and lower.
Outside in the garden pranced Muffie and
Pauline, a long tasselled drawback from the
dining-room curtains, sweeping magnificently
after each of them.</p>

<p><a name="png.129" id="png.129"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">123</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>They had thought of them first, they
insisted and, strongest reason of all, had got
them first. Max had better be a sheep or a
Manx cat, and not bother about a tail.</p>

<p>But Max, after a heart-breaking attempt
to remove the drawing-room tie-back, which
some over-provident person had stitched
firmly in its place (as if anticipating unhallowed
use being made of it), Max had gone
bursting with his woes to the one who held
his mother&#8217;s place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please run away, darling,&rdquo; said Miss
Bibby again.</p>

<p>But Max sank down to the ground, and
lifted up his voice in a bitter howl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma&mdash;I want my mamma,&rdquo; he yelled,
as if he thought that by pitching the key
high his voice might sound across the watery
waste that separated her from him.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby was not proof against this; in
fact it is just possible that Max had long
since discovered that this mode of appeal
was the most successful one he could essay.</p>

<p>She kissed and comforted him and, holding
his hand, went out of the room in search of
some article that would lend itself to the
present necessity.</p>

<p>Max dragged her to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut it off,&rdquo; he said, temptingly, &ldquo;you&#8217;ve
got lissors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is no doubt whatever that in the
<a name="png.130" id="png.130"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">124</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>circumstances Mrs. Lomax herself would have
promptly given the much-desired article.</p>

<p>But Miss Bibby had established herself as
anxious caretaker of the household chattels
as well as children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, darling!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I couldn&#8217;t
possibly. Mamma&#8217;s pretty tie-back to trail
in the dust!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&#8217;t lail it on the paths, only on
the lass,&rdquo; said Max.</p>

<p>But Miss Bibby still shook her head, and
Max began to work up from low down in his
breast another howl.</p>

<p>Then Miss Bibby had a brilliant notion.
She caught sight of a length of rope hanging
on the verandah post, relic of a hammock
that had gone the way of most hammocks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is a knife?&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and run
and get me a comb, Max.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In five minutes she had half a yard of the
excellent material beautifully unravelled, and
Max was crazy with pride and eagerness to
burst out upon the envious gaze of his sisters
thus caparisoned.</p>

<p>He could hardly wait for the realistic
affair to be fastened firmly to his belt, but
kept saying, &ldquo;be quick, be quick, Miss Bibby.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;I think I deserve a kiss, Max,&rdquo; she said
wistfully, holding the eager little man a
moment to her; this baby of the family had
made himself a very warm corner in her heart.</p>


<p class="illus pgbrk"><a name="png.131" id="png.131"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">124a</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span><img src="images/illus-131.jpg"
 width="400" height="594" alt="" title="" /><br

<p><a name="png.133" id="png.133"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">125</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Max kissed her hurriedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much do you love me, darling?&rdquo;
persisted the misguided lady.</p>

<p>Quite conceivably Mrs. Lomax was in the
habit of putting this question also, but had
learned the wisdom of confining it to sleepy
and leisure moments, and not obtruding it
upon the strenuous time of play.</p>

<p>Max struggled away. &ldquo;Big as th&#8217; sea,
big as th&#8217; stars, big as this loom, big as anything,&rdquo;
he said hastily. It was his customary
formula after this troublesome question.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;You dear little boy!&rdquo; said Miss Bibby,
kissing his soft young cheek. Then he shot
away through the door, and she went back
with rapid steps to the collar habit of Hugh
Kinross.</p>

<h3 class="chap">MISS BIBBY&#8217;S HOLIDAY</h3>


<p class="first"><span>Miss</span> Bibby worked another half-hour,
perhaps. She was nervous and excited;
she had set herself to catch the four o&#8217;clock
post, and there still were numbers of pages
with which she was dissatisfied. She was
essaying, indeed, an impossible task&mdash;trying
to couch Hugh Kinross&#8217;s eccentricities in dignified
English prose. And the shoes, at least,
absolutely refused to be so treated; they
seemed to stand out from the article just as
prominently as they had stood out among the
furniture of his room.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby sighed despairingly&mdash;the strain
and the loss of sleep were telling upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Bibby,&rdquo; shouted Pauline, bursting
into the room, &ldquo;Miss Bibby, Miss Bibby!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run away,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby; &ldquo;run away
at once, Pauline. Surely it is not much for
me to ask to have one day&mdash;just one day to
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick, quick!&rdquo; cried Pauline, &ldquo;Muffie&#8217;s
stood on an ant-bed, and she&#8217;s swarming!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.135" id="png.135"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">127</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The shoes and the far shade of the laurel
trees dropped instantly from Miss Bibby&#8217;s
horizon and, the horrors of the situation overwhelming
her, she flew after Pauline to the
victim.</p>

<p>The child&#8217;s condition was piteous; absolutely
mad with terror and pain, she was
rushing about on the path, Max, yelling with
sympathy, tearing after her. Lynn, at the
first frantic moment when she saw her sister&#8217;s
high white socks turned black with their
live covering, had leapt towards her and,
with hands and pinafore, had essayed to
sweep the things off. But the assailants
were as alarmed and angry at their position
now as the attacked and, while some sought
safety by running up Lynn&#8217;s sleeves, thus
forcing her also to dance and scream, the
remainder swarmed higher and higher up the
luckless Muffie.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby&#8217;s presence of mind quite
deserted her. The whole of her note-book
seemed to zig-zag vainly across her brain&mdash;her
note-book where she had carefully written
down antidotes for any poisons the children
might swallow, remedies for scalds, burns,
cut fingers, sprains, snake-bites. There was
nothing about ants! Yet something must be
done and instantly&mdash;the feet were the worst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick, quick! give me your foot, Muffie,&rdquo;
she cried.</p>

<p><a name="png.136" id="png.136"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">128</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The child wildly stuck out one leg.</p>

<p>And Miss Bibby with her slim white hands
seized the shoe&mdash;the shoe all black with its
fierce, prickly living mass&mdash;unlaced it and
dragged it off. Her own arms were alive
in a moment, but she merely bit her lip and
began to pull at the sock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What insanity of folly!&rdquo; cried Hugh
Kinross, sweeping her nearly off her feet,
&ldquo;here, where&#8217;s the bath-room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pauline dashed on to lead the way, and
Hugh ran the two afflicted little girls hurriedly
before him with one hand, and Miss
Bibby grasped firmly by the shoulder with
the other.</p>

<p>Once in the room, he turned on the three
taps, hot, cold and shower, all at the same
time, and followed this by dropping both
children into the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;d better follow them,&rdquo; he said, for
Miss Bibby was fidgeting about as if afflicted
with St. Vitus&#8217;s dance in her arms and shoulders.
&ldquo;Is there any ammonia in the house?
Never mind, I&#8217;ll go across and get some from
Kate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He strode away and Miss Bibby did not
lose a minute in following his advice.</p>

<p>He gave the bottle to Anna on his return,
Anna, who had only just come back from the
end of the orchard where she had found it
necessary to go and ask Blake&mdash;leisurely&mdash;for
<a name="png.137" id="png.137"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">129</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>some parsley. She was open-mouthed
at what had happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&#8217;s the armonia, Miss Bibby,&rdquo; she
said, going into the bath-room, &ldquo;and you&#8217;re
to&mdash;to pollute it with some water and rub it
on hard. Here, will I be doing, Miss Lynn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The children were gasping and gurgling
now with laughter at the funniness of the
whole affair, and even Miss Bibby was smiling
a little at the drowned appearance of all of
them.</p>

<p>She applied the ammonia to the bites, then
left Anna to help the children into dry clothing,
while, having carefully ascertained that Mr.
Kinross had quite gone, she ran along the
passages to her own bedroom, a limper lavender
lady than ever.</p>

<p>While dressing she peeped between the
laths of the blind, agitated, now the disturbance
was over, to think of the sudden arrival
of Hugh upon the scene. What a masterful
man he was! How he had grasped her
shoulder and pushed her along! But, oh! how
stupid&mdash;how stupid he must have considered her
for not thinking of water for the poor children
herself! Yes, he had called it an insanity of
folly! She peeped mournfully through the
blind.</p>

<p>And across at &ldquo;Tenby&rdquo; now was a wagonette,
with Mrs. Gowan and two such pretty,
fashionable girls in it! And out came Hugh
<a name="png.138" id="png.138"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">130</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>with a small portmanteau in his hand, and
rather a better suit on than he generally wore,
and certainly a better hat.</p>

<p>And Kate came after and kissed him good-bye!</p>

<p>Was his holiday, then, over? Was he going
back to town? Oh, no, of course! Had not
Lynn said he was going to the Jenolan Caves
for a week with his other sister and her party?
But Lynn had not said anything about those
very pretty girls! Miss Bibby sighed, she
knew not why, as the wagonette drove away.</p>

<p>Then, in a mood from which all buoyancy
had fled, drowned probably with the ants in
the unexpected bath, she began to work at the
interview again.</p>

<p>A mile along the way Hugh gave an
exclamation of annoyance; not so strong
certainly as the one Miss Bibby had overheard,
but still indicative of much vexation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went expressly to &lsquo;Greenways&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;to deliver a communication, and that ant
business drove it out of my head. I&#8217;m really
afraid I shall have to turn back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ladies protested a little. Was it very
important? As it was they would barely make
the first twenty-five miles of the journey, and
reach the first hotel of their route before dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hugh, really perturbed, &ldquo;it
is important&mdash;rather. I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll have to
go back.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.139" id="png.139"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">131</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The coachman sulkily brought his horses
round; the &ldquo;ant business&rdquo; had kept him
waiting at &ldquo;Tenby&rdquo; gate nearly half an hour,
and he had a strong objection to arriving at
hotels when the dinner hour was long past
and the cook, pettish at having to set to work
again, quite callous about what she set before
him.</p>

<p>But at the critical moment Larkin appeared&mdash;Larkin
who had a perfect genius for
appearing on the spot when he was wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello! here&#8217;s Middlecut to the rescue,&rdquo;
Hugh cried, hailing him with a shout. &ldquo;Hi,
young man, can you go off on a message for
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Larkin grinned and nodded assent. He
had no notion why the book gentleman
always gave him this name of Middlecut, but
he had also no objection. Any gentleman
who made his commission advance by leaps
and bounds, as this one had done, was at
liberty to call him any name that came
handy.</p>

<p>Hugh had his fountain-pen, but no further
vehicle for his message; none of the ladies
could help him with as much as a visiting
card&mdash;what help in emergencies can be expected
from pocketless persons?</p>

<p>Larkin came to the rescue with the eternal
card of Octavius Smith and his bacon at
elevenpence.</p>

<div class="epistle">
<p><a name="png.140" id="png.140"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">132</span><span class="ns">]
 </span><span class="smcap">&ldquo;Dear Madam&rdquo;</span> (wrote Hugh upon the
back of this choice stationery), &ldquo;kindly burn
any nonsense I may have said to you yesterday.
On my return in a week I will see what
I can do to give you better information. I
was on my way to tell you this when Muffie&#8217;s
engaging adventure drove it out of my head.
Pray excuse this card&mdash;necessity knows no
etiquette.</p>

<p class="rt4">&ldquo;Yours,</p>

<p class="rt2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Hugh Kinross</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>A minute later the wagonette was gaily
upon its way again, Hugh in excellent spirits
now he had laid the little demon of compunction
that had been troubling his kind
heart since breakfast.</p>

<p>And Larkin was cantering happily down
to &ldquo;Greenways,&rdquo; his own pocket (he kept his
right-hand pocket for the money due to
Octavius, and his left-hand for his own tips)
the heavier by a shilling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Bibby, Miss Bibby!&rdquo; cried Pauline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now what is it?&rdquo; said Miss Bibby,
whose nerves by this time were in a condition
that made the reiteration of her own name
a positive offence to her. She was dressed
for going to the post, and had a long official
envelope directed &ldquo;To the Editor of the
<cite>Evening Mail</cite>&rdquo; tucked under her arm. But
she had paused by the kitchen fire on her way
<a name="png.141" id="png.141"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">133</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>out to superintend the blancmange which
Anna was making for the children&#8217;s tea, and
which, they complained bitterly, she always
made lumpy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Larkin is at the door,&rdquo; said Pauline,
&ldquo;and he&#8217;s got something for you from Mr.
Kinross.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where, where?&rdquo; said Miss Bibby, fluttering
forward. Larkin passed the card to
Pauline. Pauline passed it to Miss Bibby&mdash;and
on such small things does our destiny
hang&mdash;the wrong side up.</p>

<p>That is to say the nauseating statement
about the prime middle cut at elevenpence
a pound was what met the eye of the eager
Miss Bibby.</p>

<p>An ebullition of anger such as rarely visited
the gentle lady rose within her now.</p>

<p>She flung the card angrily into the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a very rude little girl, Pauline,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;it is excessively ill-bred to play
jokes upon people older than yourself. And
as for Larkin&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Larkin had disappeared, his shilling
being earned, and some business urgently
needing his attendance.</p>

<p>Pauline slipped away to the garden, a
resigned look upon her face. She had not
meant to be ill-bred; she had no idea she was
playing a joke. But she remembered now
that Miss Bibby had several times swept
<a name="png.142" id="png.142"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">134</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>down the cards of Octavius that they had
placed on the drawing-room mantelpiece as
a means of attracting any visitors&#8217; custom
to Larkin. Still she need not have spoken
in that angry tone, and called her &ldquo;ill-bred.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ill-bred&rdquo; was a very uncomfortable word to
have suddenly thrust upon one. Pauline
leapt up at the gymnastic bar, and swung
and wriggled there to shake it off.</p>

<p>Hot and perspiring after several brilliant
efforts, that included hanging by the feet, and
swinging upwards again, and resuming the
perpendicular, Pauline climbed up and sat
on the bar, holding to a post and dangling
her legs.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">From here through a break in the trees
she could see the hill, and climbing up it
steadily, steadily, Miss Bibby with her long
precious envelope for the post tucked beneath
her arm.</p>

<h3 class="chap">IN BLACK AND WHITE</h3>


<p class="first">Four days later Kate was reading, rocking
and eating banana again in the
privacy of the little side verandah, when
there came a familiar tramp across the room
behind her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&#8217;t be Hugh,&rdquo; she said aloud, for
it had been allowed by the whole party that
the seven days of a week were not too long
to devote to the thorough &ldquo;doing&rdquo; of the
marvellous caves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By George though, can&#8217;t it?&rdquo; said that
gentleman as he came through the doorway,
dropped his bag on one chair, and sat down
heavily on another.</p>

<p>Kate laughed at him outright; his linen
suit was red over with fine dust, dust lay half
an inch deep on the brim of his Panama, his
very eyebrows were red with the molecules of
the mountain roads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my girl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was worth
it&mdash;well worth it. Blessed be motor-cars
<a name="png.144" id="png.144"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">136</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>henceforth and forever, though hitherto I&#8217;ve
never had a good word to throw at one. Great
Scott! to think of it; but for the chance
of one chap laying another fifty to a hundred
that his car could do the journey down in ten
minutes under the other chap&#8217;s, those girls
would be jabbering in my ears yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I thought they were such wonderful
girls,&rdquo; said Kate amusedly; &ldquo;&lsquo;ducky little
girls&rsquo;, you called them, and &lsquo;little pets&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s all very well,&rdquo; said Hugh; &ldquo;little
pets are very nice in their place, and no one
appreciates them better than faithfully yours,
for an hour or so. But when you get &#8217;em
for breakfast and lunch and dinner. And
they even insist upon trifling with the holies
of your smoking times, trying to light up
cigarettes themselves, and jabbering all the
time, why then you seize on a civil offer
to risk your neck in a racing car as a drowning
man would catch at a torpedo if he found it
floating handy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to have returned heart-whole,
at all events,&rdquo; said Kate; &ldquo;and I&#8217;ve had my
suspicions of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hugh, fanning himself composedly
with a newspaper, &ldquo;my day is not
yet, though as I&#8217;ve told you before I&#8217;m like
the fellow in the comic opera, there is that
within me that tells me that when my time
<em>does</em> come the convulsion will be tremendous!
<a name="png.145" id="png.145"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">137</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>When I love, it will be with the accumulated
fervour of sixty-six years! But I have an
ideal&mdash;a semi-transparent Being filled with
an inorganic fruit jelly&mdash;and I have never
yet seen the woman who approaches within
reasonable distance of it. All&mdash;all opaque&mdash;opaque&mdash;opaque.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kate laughed. &ldquo;Then I&#8217;m afraid you don&#8217;t
feel much better for the change,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>They had both hoped that a week&#8217;s &ldquo;junketing&rdquo;
with lively companions might bring
back the pen&#8217;s good hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better!&rdquo; he groaned, &ldquo;why the day
you let that Bibby woman loose on me I
was a flowing river compared to my mood
to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that a recollection evidently came over
Kate, some memory that the unexpected
arrival had driven away, for she froze
visibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go and make you a lemon-squash,&rdquo;
she said coldly; &ldquo;you are possibly thirsty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirsty!&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;my outward
and visible dust is nothing to what I&#8217;ve
swallowed! Make me six lemon-squashes.
But what&#8217;s the matter, Kit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She made no answer, merely turned one
severe glance on him and went off to the
pantry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do tell me, Kate,&rdquo; he said, after he had
lowered the large jugful she brought him, and
<a name="png.146" id="png.146"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">138</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>still she had made no further remark. &ldquo;Nothing&#8217;s
happened to the bike, has it? You&#8217;ve
not smashed your precious nose? No, it
seems intact. Has the low-spirited Ellen
given notice? Has Octavius been charging
more than elevenpence for his bacon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Kate preserved a stony silence; she
even picked up her book again and affected
to read. He drew the volume out of her
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be
merry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t feel as if I could ever be merry
again with you, Hugh,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And here have I,&rdquo; he said, addressing the
verandah ceiling, &ldquo;passed through dangers
enough to make me loved, Othello-wise, for
themselves alone. Dangers of culverts, dangers
of sharp turnings, dangers of blue metal,
of precipices, of wandering cows, of naphtha
explosions. Here have I turned myself into a
demd damp moist unpleasant body just to
get to her sheltering bosom and she repulses
me like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is because I am what I have never
been before, Hugh,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;and that is
ashamed of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ashamed? Of me, my joy!&rdquo; said Hugh,
but he knew now that it was the interview
outrage that was disturbing Kate. &ldquo;It knows
it is talking demd charming sweetness but
<a name="png.147" id="png.147"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">139</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>naughty fibs. It knows it is not ashamed of
its own popolorum tibby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which is entirely attributable,&rdquo; said
Kate, unable to resist keeping up the vein,
&ldquo;to the gross misconduct and most improper
behaviour of Mr. Mantalini.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of me, my essential juice of pineapple!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of you, Sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will she call me, Sir!&rdquo; cried Hugh,
&ldquo;me who doat upon her with the demdest
ardour! She, who coils her fascination round
me like a pure and angelic rattlesnake! It
will be all up with my feelings; she will
throw me into a demd state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;it is far too serious a
matter for nonsense. I consider it was not
only unkind but unmanly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My cup of happiness&#8217;s sweetener,&rdquo; said
Hugh, as he took out his pipe and his tobacco
and his matches with much deliberation.
&ldquo;You brought it upon her yourself and she
has <em>you</em> to blame.&rdquo; He filled his pipe with
tobacco and rammed it well in. &ldquo;It will
be a lesson to you&rdquo;&mdash;he struck a match&mdash;&ldquo;and
I trust to her&rdquo;&mdash;he tilted his chair
back and puffed once or twice&mdash;&ldquo;to let
an inoffensive man go on his way unmolested.
And now my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be
merry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you might have given her the lesson
privately,&rdquo; persisted Kate, and her eyes
<a name="png.148" id="png.148"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">140</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>kindled. &ldquo;The unmanly part comes in when
you callously allow her to become the laughing-stock
of town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; thundered Hugh, and he brought
his chair so suddenly and heavily back to its
four-legged condition that the frail thing
responded with an ominous creak. &ldquo;What
on earth do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&#8217;t you know she was going to sign
the interview with her own name?&rdquo; asked
Kate, glad to find there might be some
extenuating circumstances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&#8217;t mean seriously to tell me she&#8217;s
gone and published that fool of an interview?&rdquo;
Hugh shouted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do seriously so mean,&rdquo; said Kate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go and get me the paper,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Kate brought him the <cite>Evening Mail</cite> of
two days back.</p>

<p>And there in black headlines he read&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only interview Hugh Kinross has ever
granted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lady beards the lion in his den and
extracts most interesting particulars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The eccentricities of a great author.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Agnes Bibby&#8217;s neat MS. had reached
the Editor of the <cite>Evening Mail</cite> that gentleman
had fairly shouted with laughter, for he knew
Kinross and his habits well. And this perfervid
and most serious account was in truth
very funny.</p>

<p><a name="png.149" id="png.149"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">141</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>He found himself quite unable to resist
so unique an opportunity of raising a roar of
laughter among his readers. Therefore, telling
himself that Kinross had too much humour to
be seriously annoyed, and holding himself protected
by the well-known signature authenticating
it, he had at once blue-pencilled
the article and sent it precisely as it stood
into the hands of the foreman printer. His
twinkling eye had practically swept over
without noticing the modest signature at the
end of the article, &ldquo;Agnes Bibby (Burunda).&rdquo;
Else, for the sake of Thomas downstairs, if
not for the lady herself, he would have scored
it through and let the laugh go against an
anonymous contributor.</p>

<p>But things move rapidly in the office of
an evening paper, and the foreman ran
through the first proofs and the sub-editor
through the second, and neither thought of
removing that poor little name at the
end.</p>

<p>And now the article was two days old and
quite famous. There had not been a copy
left of any of the editions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Hugh as he seized the
paper, and ran his eye over the paragraphs
concerning his collar habit and his shoe habit,
and his ante-prandial energy,&mdash;&ldquo;the laugh&#8217;s
only up against myself, and I&#8217;m not thin-skinned.&rdquo;
Then he saw the signature at the
<a name="png.150" id="png.150"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">142</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>end, &ldquo;Agnes Bibby (Burunda),&rdquo; in large,
clear type.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By George!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;by George, Kate!
That&#8217;s rough on her.&rdquo; He breathed hard.
&ldquo;Do you think she has seen it yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seen it!&rdquo; said Kate, and her voice
actually choked a little. &ldquo;The poor girl
is breaking her heart over it. I have never
known any one feel anything so acutely. Of
course she must have realized it was all a joke
the moment she read the Editor&#8217;s facetious
comments. And then it seems she has a
brother in the office, and he has written to
her a brotherly letter explaining elaborately
how she is the laughing-stock of the whole
town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; repeated Hugh; &ldquo;by Jove!&rdquo;
He seemed quite stunned. &ldquo;Have you seen
her yet, K? Does she seem at all cut up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seen her!&rdquo; repeated Kate, her mouth
a-tremble with sympathy. &ldquo;Yes, I went
over at once, and she saw me coming and
ran this way and then that to get away
from me. And when she couldn&#8217;t she just
dropped down against the bank on the lawn
and sobbed and cried as heartbrokenly as
Muffie might have done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say!&rdquo; said Hugh. He gulped a lump
from his throat. &ldquo;I say!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he turned on his heel and strode
through the cottage and over the verandah
<a name="png.151" id="png.151"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">143</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and through the &ldquo;Tenby&rdquo; garden and across
the road and away down &ldquo;Greenways&rdquo; drive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless the boy!&rdquo; said Kate, wiping her
eyes. &ldquo;I know he didn&#8217;t mean to hurt the
poor thing.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="chap">AN INTERVIEW WITH THE INTERVIEWER</h3>


<p class="first"><span>He</span> could hardly wait to ring the bell; the
front door was open and seemed to
suggest that he should stride in and march
directly to the room from which children&#8217;s
voices were coming and where the victim of
his brutality most likely also was sitting.</p>

<p>But he thought better of such behaviour
and loudly rang the bell.</p>

<p>Anna came down the hall, evidently
trying to restrain a giggle at his dusty appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Miss Bibby in?&rdquo; he demanded sternly.</p>

<p>Anna looked uncertainly at the sitting-room
door. &ldquo;I&mdash;don&#8217;t know for certain.
Will I go and see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, immediately, please,&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>

<p>She did not ask him in at once: instead
she took a few steps to the sitting-room door,
opened it, giggled at the children, smoothed
her face and turned round again.</p>

<p><a name="png.153" id="png.153"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">145</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;She&#8217;s not in there, sir,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Will
you come in and sit down, and I&#8217;ll go and see
if she&#8217;s anywhere else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hugh strode into the sitting-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&#8217;d think he&#8217;d wash hisself afore
he came calling on a lady,&rdquo; said Anna to
herself as she went in search of Miss Bibby,
&ldquo;an&#8217; brush his dirty hat. If that&#8217;s what
making books brings you to, give me bread,&rdquo;
and she sent a loving thought to a certain
dapper baker of her acquaintance.</p>

<p>In the sitting-room Pauline had screwed
herself round and round on the piano stool
till her knees were higher than the keyboard
and she was able to contemplate her Serenade
from a new point of view. She looked at
Hugh in some excitement but without speaking.</p>

<p>Lynn, Muffie and Max had evidently been
at work on their letters, but had all evidently
pulled up suddenly, for each displayed a blot
as a full stop.</p>

<p>Max was the first to recover himself. He
remembered he had a use for this man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ling me a lalagmite?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; cried Muffie, &ldquo;our stalagtites,&mdash;did
you break some off? We knowed a boy
that got one in a dark cave when the guard
wasn&#8217;t looking and pushed it up his sleeve
to carry. Did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.154" id="png.154"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">146</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Not this time,&rdquo; said Hugh; &ldquo;but look here,
young people, I didn&#8217;t come to see you to-day.
Where&#8217;s Miss Bibby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this question Paul began to revolve
faster and faster on a downward journey
simply to save herself the embarrassment of
answering, and Lynn fell to writing a new
sentence in her letter with great assiduity.</p>

<p>But Muffie had no qualms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She doesn&#8217;t want to see you, and she said
we could talk to you and she wasn&#8217;t at home,&rdquo;
she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she doesn&#8217;t know yet who it is,&rdquo;
objected Hugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes she does,&rdquo; said Muffie, &ldquo;she sawed
you coming up the path.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&#8217; she lushed out of the loom,&rdquo; volunteered
Max.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;she&#8217;s got to see me,
for it&#8217;s very important. Will you go to her
room, Muffie, and say Mr. Kinross begs to see
her as a special favour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Muffie, &ldquo;she isn&#8217;t in her room.
When you say you&#8217;re not at home you go
and stand out in the garden till the visitors
go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&#8217;t,&rdquo; argued Lynn, &ldquo;only Mrs.
Merrick; but mother says &lsquo;No,&rsquo; an&#8217; she never
does, an&#8217; it just means &lsquo;engaged,&rsquo; only it&#8217;s not
so rude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hugh desperately, &ldquo;will you
<a name="png.155" id="png.155"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">147</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>penetrate to the spot in the garden where Miss
Bibby&#8217;s notions of honour may have taken
her, Lynn, and say Mr. Kinross will be greatly
obliged if she will see him for five minutes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really couldn&#8217;t,&rdquo; said Lynn distressedly.
&ldquo;I&#8217;m very sorry, but I&#8217;m sure she wouldn&#8217;t
like me to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;I shall simply go
and find her myself,&rdquo; and he pushed up the
French window and stepped out into the
garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>We</em> gen&#8217;ally hide ahind the waratahs or
the bamboos, or up a tree&#8217;s a good place,&rdquo;
said Muffie, much interested.</p>

<p>If it were hide-and-seek about to begin, this
is where Max shone. He laid down his pen
and slipped down from his chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll find her for you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I find
licker than any one. Once I found Paul an&#8217;
she was lapped up in the sheets in the linen
less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Hugh had made off towards the bamboos
without any help. He could see a
moving dress beyond the loose striped
leaves.</p>

<p>At the sound of footsteps on the gravel the
skirts moved rapidly away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Very well,
Miss Bibby, it&#8217;s not dignified for persons of
our age, but you&#8217;ll give up this chase before
I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.156" id="png.156"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">148</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>She must have realized this, for, when they
neared the waratahs she stood absolutely still
and waited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;re in for it now, my fine chap,&rdquo; Hugh
said to himself, &ldquo;and she&#8217;ll weep&mdash;she&#8217;s
just the sort to weep. Well, you jolly well
deserve it, you brute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he walked up to her.</p>

<p>She wore a dark blue cambric to-day with a
soft leather belt and dainty white muslin
cuffs and collar as a relief. The costume
suited her infinitely better than the limp
lavender had done.</p>

<p>The colour was ebbing and flowing in her
cheeks; her grey eyes wore their startled
expression. But she held out her slim hand,
albeit it trembled a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Mr. Kinross,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;slightly pleasanter weather, is it not?
Though I rather expect a thunderstorm,
and then perhaps that will be the end of heat
waves this summer. What do you think?
Must we expect another?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;I really don&#8217;t
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Lomax writes that it is delightful in
New Zealand just now&mdash;just like fresh spring
weather all the time. Both she and the
Judge are feeling better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear it,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are at Rotorua at present,&rdquo; Miss
<a name="png.157" id="png.157"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">149</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Bibby persisted. &ldquo;The Judge is fortunate
enough to have among his memories that of
the country before the Pink and White
Terraces were swallowed up. But they write
that all is very beautiful still. Of course you
have been in New Zealand, Mr. Kinross?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Bibby,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;I did not
come to talk of Pink and White Terraces to
you before I removed the dust of my journey.
I want to tell you how sorry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather talk of the Terraces, Mr.
Kinross,&rdquo; Miss Bibby said, with a gentle
dignity of manner that surprised him. But
her soft lip quivered one moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, by George, Kate,&rdquo; he said afterwards,
recounting the interview to his sister,
&ldquo;I nearly kissed her on the spot&mdash;just like
I do you when I&#8217;ve been ramping round and
have hurt you and want to make up. She
was taking it so gamely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I must talk of it,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;What
a low ruffian you must consider me! I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&mdash;I quite understand
now. I was importunate and at an
infelicitous time. I recognize that I brought
it upon myself. Well, people will forget
about it presently&mdash;a new sensation will
come along,&rdquo; she smiled faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was in a vile temper that afternoon,
certainly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I treated you
shamefully. But what I do want to make
<a name="png.158" id="png.158"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">150</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>you realize is that I would have cut off my
hand rather than have made you&mdash;or any
one&mdash;publicly ridiculous. Will you believe
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She only looked at him very gently and
without speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t you remember my coming up here&mdash;four
or five days ago now? I was coming
to tell you to burn the stuff, and then you
know one of the youngsters stirred up an ant-bed
and drove it out of my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said politely; &ldquo;oh, yes, that
was quite enough to put it out of your head.&rdquo;
But she looked away from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, as you know,&rdquo; pursued Hugh, &ldquo;I
have been at the Caves ever since. But I
took the precaution the moment I remembered
to send you word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now she was looking at him. &ldquo;I received
no message.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That scoundrelly young Larkin&mdash;do you
say that he did not bring you a note from
me?&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I had no note,&rdquo; she said faintly.
&ldquo;He must have lost it or have forgotten
to bring it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is it,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;but I still blame
myself. I ought to have turned back when I
remembered and not have trusted a lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There he is now. Oh, Larkin! Larkin!&rdquo;
murmured Miss Bibby in the tone Sir Isaac
<a name="png.159" id="png.159"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">151</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Newton must have used when his dog Diamond
did him the irreparable mischief.</p>

<p>Yes, there was Larkin, riding gaily off down
the path to the gate, an empty basket swung
on one arm. He had just received another
commission from Anna&mdash;a large bottle of
patent medicine and a complexion remedy,
and as he had lately extended the field of his
operation by acting as a sort of travelling
agent (on commission) for a chemist in an
adjoining village, it brought the piano and the
grocery emporium a little closer.</p>

<p>Hugh gave a peremptory whistle and the
boy looked over his shoulder, then responded
to the beckon by bringing his horse sharply
round and cantering briskly across to the
waratahs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something else, Miss Bibby, ma&#8217;am?&rdquo;
he said, whipping out his order book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by not delivering the
note I gave you from the wagonette on
Thursday?&rdquo; said Hugh angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did deliver it!&rdquo; said Larkin in much
indignation, &ldquo;which I can say honest, sir; I
never neglected a message yet. And that&#8217;s
why our business is what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom did you give it to?&rdquo; said Miss
Bibby. &ldquo;Was it to one of the children?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much, ma&#8217;am,&rdquo; said Larkin, in open
scorn. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t do business that ways, knowin&#8217;
well what kids&mdash;begging yer pardon, children
<a name="png.160" id="png.160"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">152</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>are. I did hand it to the oldest of &#8217;em,
certainly, but I took the precaution, Miss
Bibby, ma&#8217;am, to stay at the door till I seen
her hand it to you. You was standin&#8217; by the
fire and I seen it <em>acshally in yer hand</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that was no letter,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby,
a faint recollection stealing over her, &ldquo;it was
one of your trade cards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was on one of those I wrote,&rdquo; said
Hugh, &ldquo;having no other paper. I remember
apologizing for using it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I burnt it!&rdquo; said Miss Bibby in a
stricken tone. &ldquo;Tossed it on the fire without
a glance&mdash;I thought they were playing me
a trick! Poor Pauline&mdash;I&mdash;must apologize
to Pauline.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can go,&rdquo; said Hugh to Larkin, &ldquo;and
here&#8217;s a shilling to wipe the momentary slur
off from your character.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Larkin rode off, vindicated, slapping
the left-hand pocket of his trousers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does it make my crime a little less
brutal?&rdquo; said Hugh gently.</p>

<p>She put out her slim white hand again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us forget about it,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I
shall soon live it down.&rdquo; Her eyes flashed
for a moment bravely up to his.</p>

<p>He gripped her hand hard, shook it several
times, and told her she had behaved in a
manner altogether more generous than he
deserved.</p>

<p><a name="png.161" id="png.161"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">153</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;If you want to make me a little more
comfortable in my own mind,&rdquo; he said as he
was leaving, &ldquo;you will give me something to
do for you. Can I&mdash;my sister tells me you
write a great deal and&mdash;and have not had
any very great fortune with the editors and
publishers yet. Is there any MS I could
read&mdash;and perhaps presume to offer a little
advice upon? It would make me very
happy&mdash;that is, if you have sufficient confidence
in me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The humble, anxious note in his voice
would have amazed several score of his readers
who had written to him to ask him, since he
was a literary man, to read through an accompanying
bulky parcel of MS, advise about
its faults and give hints about publishing.
For these persons&mdash;anathema maranatha to
all authors&mdash;received by return of post one of
a large packet of printed slips that stood ever
ready on Hugh&#8217;s desk, and learned briefly
that &ldquo;Mr. Hugh Kinross, being neither a
literary agent nor a philanthropist but merely
a working man with a market value on every
hour, begs to repudiate the honour his correspondent
would do him, and informs him
that his MS will be returned on receipt
of stamps to cover postage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Bibby was not proof against this offer.
She gave Hugh one look of intense gratitude
and hurried into the house, returning
<a name="png.162" id="png.162"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">154</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>presently with a small roll of typewritten
MS&mdash;her latest creation, <cite>Hypocrites</cite>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This story,&rdquo; she said quite tremulously&mdash;&ldquo;Oh,
I am so anxious, so very anxious about it.
The editor of the <cite>Evening Mail</cite>&mdash;has promised
to use one of mine; it will be&mdash;well, not
quite my first story in print, but certainly the
first one paid for. There is such a difference,
isn&#8217;t there? Nearly any one can get a story
into print if they want no remuneration.
You can understand how anxious I am that
it should be good. I sent it to be typed in
town so that it would present a better appearance.
It has just come back by the post.
Oh! if you <em>could</em> spare time to glance at it. Is
it too much to ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed at her. &ldquo;A bit of a story like
that&mdash;three thousand words at the most!
You are too modest, Miss Bibby. You should
have brought me a packet weighing about
half a hundredweight as the rest of them
send me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no;&mdash;just that I am pinning all
my hopes on <cite>Hypocrites</cite>.&rdquo; A wave of
pink was in her cheeks, her eyes shone
softly.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;With the greatest pleasure in life,&rdquo; said
Hugh heartily, and tucked the little roll
beneath his arm. &ldquo;And now I had better

<h3 class="chap">THE LITERARY MICROBE</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="uc"><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;W</span>e</span> are contagious,&rdquo; Pauline announced
honestly and courageously at the
advent of every stranger, however interesting.</p>

<p>And Lynn, equally careful it has been seen,
refused to hold any intercourse with the
author at &ldquo;Tenby&rdquo; until the searching question,
&ldquo;Have you had whooping cough?&rdquo;
had been put to him.</p>

<p>Yet here was Hugh Kinross himself taking
no precaution whatever to protect the neighbouring
&ldquo;Greenways&rdquo; from contagion, and
the result was that the literary microbe was
wafted across the road in a surprisingly short
space of time.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby certainly could not be said to
be infected for the first time, though there
was no doubt that since the new tenants had
come to &ldquo;Tenby&rdquo; the disease had taken a
much more aggravated form with her.</p>

<p>But Anna one afternoon made a solemn
excursion to the store of Septimus Smith and
<a name="png.167" id="png.167"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">157</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>purchased one exercise-book, one pen, one
bottle of ink and one blotting-pad.</p>

<p>She had hitherto regarded the making of
books as some occult art practised by certain
persons, mostly as dead and as distant as one
Shakespeare whose fame had faintly reached
her.</p>

<p>But when there came into the unpretentious
cottage across the road the actual
author of a printed book that lay on a table
in the drawing-room; and when this actual
author was discovered on near view to be a
rather stout man with a shockingly bad hat
and creases all over his linen coats; and
when the maid who dwelt in the same house
with this actual author testified, during the
course of a gossip, that he was in no wise
different from other men&mdash;which is to say, he
made no end of a fuss if the toast was not to
his liking and threw his burnt matches down
anywhere, and shouted angrily if there was
no soap in the bathroom&mdash;why then, when
all these things were discovered, Anna simply
walked up to the store one fine afternoon
and set herself up in the stock-in-trade of an
author, marvelling that it had never before
occurred to her to write a book.</p>

<p>But after she had done a very few chapters
she craved a reading audience. Blake the
gardener, she determined, was too surly for
this office, and too sleepy; his day&#8217;s work
<a name="png.168" id="png.168"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">158</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>so near to Nature&#8217;s heart and at such an
altitude made him nod by seven o&#8217;clock in
the evening. And one could hardly follow
after him as he trundled about with his barrow
in the daytime and read aloud to him
how it was discovered that the lovely Annabell
Deloitte, who was a nursery governess
in a lord&#8217;s family, had been changed in the
cradle and was really the Lady Florentine
Trelawney.</p>

<p>And Miss Bibby, for all her gentleness,
was too &ldquo;stand-offish&rdquo; for the position of
listener. Anna at once rejected any idea
of asking that lady to undertake the work.</p>

<p>But the children made a delightful audience
and clamoured eagerly, the moment
they reached the foot of the waterfall, for the
&ldquo;book&rdquo; to be produced from the secret
recesses of Anna&#8217;s umbrella (in which it hid
itself from Miss Bibby&#8217;s eyes), and for the
enthralling woes of the Lady Florentine
Trelawney to be at once continued.</p>

<p>So it may be concluded that it was Anna
who acted as the direct vehicle for the transmission
of the literary infection to the children
themselves.</p>

<p>The logic of the matter was very simple.</p>

<p>If Anna could write a book&mdash;Anna who
was to be frequently seen with black smuts
from the stove all over her face; Anna who
did not know that the reign of William the
<a name="png.169" id="png.169"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">159</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Conqueror was 1066 to 1087, nor where sago
came from, nor what were the calyx and the
stamen of a flower (had they not themselves
tested her?)&mdash;well, if Anna could make up
a book, so could they&mdash;every one of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will cost us twopence each,&rdquo; said
Pauline calculatingly, &ldquo;but we can afford it;
it&#8217;s nearly the day for our sixpences again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted my last tuppence for some pink
wool&mdash;can&#8217;t you find some paper in the
house?&rdquo; said Muffie on discovering that the
disbursement Pauline declared necessary was
for mere paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Pauline firmly; &ldquo;authors
always have plenty of clean paper. I won&#8217;t
use the half sheets Miss Bibby gives us to
scribble on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; <em>do</em> let us use proper paper,&rdquo;
cried Lynn, who had had far too many poetic
fancies nipped in the bud for want of this
precious transmitting material.</p>

<p>So the purchases were made and the
eightpennyworth of paper made a very
respectable show upon the table of the
summer-house, to which they had retreated
to ensure privacy to themselves for the
arduous undertaking.</p>

<p>Pauline sat at the head of the table, the
others ranged almost meekly around her.
Hers was a responsible position and she
intended them all to realize it.</p>

<p><a name="png.170" id="png.170"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">160</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>For while it was one thing for all to say
lightly, &ldquo;We will write a book each,&rdquo; the
matter resolved itself into all the actual
writing falling to Pauline, for the sad and
simple reason that none of the others <em>could</em>
write.</p>

<p>So Pauline leaned back and gave herself
airs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall write my own story first,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;and you are none of you to speak a
word to interrupt me, or I won&#8217;t write yours
at all. Max, stop scratching on the table;
Muffie, don&#8217;t shuffle your feet like that, you
put my vein out.&rdquo; The last was a slightly
tangled remark picked up from Miss Kinross
who had been heard to speak of various
interruptions putting her brother out of vein.</p>

<p>Muffie, thwarted in her desire to scratch a
horse upon the surface of the table, fell to
filling up a crack in it with sand scooped up
from the floor and mixed, when the writing
lady was not looking, to a pleasing consistency
with ink.</p>

<p>Lynn lay face downwards on a bench and
bent all her energies to composing the story
that Pauline would shortly write at her
dictation.</p>

<p>Max simply strolled to the door; the little
girls might be under Pauline&#8217;s thumb, but
no one expected him really to obey any one
except his father.</p>

<p><a name="png.171" id="png.171"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">161</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Call me when you&#8217;re leady,&rdquo; he said to
Pauline, &ldquo;I&#8217;ll be sitting on the loof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Muffie, suffering from her enforced
inactivity, soon had the tantalizing sight of
sections of his brown legs displayed through
the lattice work above her head.</p>

<p>Scratch, scratch went Pauline&#8217;s pen&mdash;scratch,
scratch along line after line. Evidently she
was not troubled with any lack of ideas.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes, half an hour slipped
away. Lynn had long since composed her
tale and had fallen to playing a fairy drama
at the end of her bench with bits of moss and
white pebbles from the floor.</p>

<p>Max had tumbled twice through a hole
in the lattice roof, and had on each occasion
blotted Pauline&#8217;s precious MS by the precipitation
of his whole body upon it.</p>

<p>Sore, therefore, about his knees and elbows,
he had given up his lofty perch and betaken
himself to his oft-essayed task of digging a
hole in the ground, to reach the fire that the
kindergarten governess had informed him
burnt in the middle of the earth.</p>

<p>And Muffie now occupied the seat on the
summer-house roof, and did not lose the
opportunity of demonstrating to Max that
girls kept their balance much better than
boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve finished&mdash;come and listen,&rdquo; cried
Pauline at last.</p>

<p><a name="png.172" id="png.172"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">162</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Lynn sat upright at once and tried to
disentangle her drama from her story. Muffie
slid comfortably down from her perch. But
Max was not ready.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minte,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I&#8217;m nearly
down to the fire&mdash;oh, oh, I can feel it on my
hand&mdash;I b&#8217;leeve my spade&#8217;s aginning to
melt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Pauline insisted on his instant attendance
within doors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Once upon a time&rsquo;,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;&lsquo;there
was a beautiful mother&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As beautiful as ours?&rdquo; asked Lynn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beautifuller,&rdquo; said Pauline.</p>

<p>Lynn argued the point hotly, with Muffie
to back her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She <em>couldn&#8217;t</em> be,&rdquo; they said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she could&mdash;in a book,&rdquo; said Pauline.
&ldquo;I&#8217;m not talking about really truly, of course.
But in a book they can be as lovely as lovely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So is mother,&rdquo; said the little girls stoutly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; said Pauline, and her
heart softening to the distant dear one, she
said, &ldquo;Well, &lsquo;once &#8217;pon a time there was a
mother as beautiful as our mother, and she
died&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh,&rdquo; said Lynn. &ldquo;Oh, I wish
mamma was here. Oh, I don&#8217;t like your
story a bit, Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silly,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;this is only a book
mother&mdash;it doesn&#8217;t hurt book mothers to
<a name="png.173" id="png.173"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">163</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>die. Now just stop interrupting me. Well,
she died&mdash;she&#8217;s just got to die or the rest
of the story can&#8217;t happen. The beautiful
mother died, &lsquo;and one day when Emmeline
was sitting in the spachius drawing-room of
the castle&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&#8217;s Emmeline?&rdquo; asked Muffie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how stupid you are,&rdquo; cried Pauline;
&ldquo;she&#8217;s the daughter, of course,&mdash;&lsquo;sitting in
the spachius drawing-room of the castle her
father strode in, and he led by the hand a very
horty lady. &ldquo;This is your new mother and
I command you to obey her, my lady Emmeline,&rdquo;
he said. Emmeline fainted to the
ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Her father the noble lord was always out
at his office and didn&#8217;t know how the horty
step-mother treated Emmeline, but she grew
thinner and paler every day, and all her face
went transparant and the blue veins were
trased in their pallor and her little hand was
like a skellington&#8217;s; and the cruel step-mother
made her do all the scrubbing and hard work,
and treated her like a menient. And one
day the Lady Emmeline disappeared and
was never found again. But twenty years
afterwards the wainscotching in the castle
was being mended, and they found her lying
behind it, her long eyelashes resting on the
marble pallor of her cheeks, her little hands
clasped in their last long sleep, quite dead.
<a name="png.174" id="png.174"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">164</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>And the noble lord wept bitterly and resolved
never to have another step-mother, and
he built a monyment with a white angel
to her memory&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lynn was quite moved by the story, and
gulped down a sob which made Paul most
gracious and grateful to her.</p>

<p>But Muffie sniffed. &ldquo;Well, she was a
silly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why didn&#8217;t she bang and
kick on the wall like the time I hid in the
cupboard and the door got shut? Every
one heard me in a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wainscotching&#8217;s much thicker than common
cupboards,&rdquo; said Paul disdainfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;d have got my axe and chopped and
chopped and walked light out and chopped
off the woman&#8217;s head and put her down my
hole,&rdquo; said Max.</p>

<p>Then it was Lynn&#8217;s turn.</p>

<p>She dictated rapidly, occasionally waving
her arms dramatically to heighten the effect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A key lay on the ground. The moon was
up. Purple was on the mountains, and all
in the valley lay the snow-white mist. Black
pine trees stood in a long, long row, like the
ghosts of tall soldiers. The sun was setting,
and orange and purple flamed in the sky.
The moon was very young and thin and was
just climbing up the other side of the sky.
The sun&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say,&rdquo; said Pauline, &ldquo;isn&#8217;t anything
<a name="png.175" id="png.175"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">165</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>ever going to happen? I&#8217;m tired of the sun
and the moon. I always skip that kind of
thing in books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Paul!&rdquo; said Lynn, &ldquo;that&#8217;s the best
part. You can make such lovely pictures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The sun was&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pauline folded her arms. &ldquo;I won&#8217;t write
another word about the sun,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the moon&mdash;&rdquo; said Lynn beseechingly.
&ldquo;Just say &lsquo;the moon looked like a
far-off silver boat.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Paul; &ldquo;you&#8217;ve said once it
looked like a starved baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&#8217;t,&rdquo; said Lynn indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;&lsquo;young and thin,&rsquo; that&#8217;s the same
thing,&rdquo; said Pauline. &ldquo;Now get on to something
else. What about the key?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The key lay on the ground&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Lynn
resignedly, &ldquo;&lsquo;and sparkled in the darkness&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keys <em>don&#8217;t</em> sparkle in the darkness, but
go on,&rdquo; said Paul, writing away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This one did,&rdquo; persisted the poor little
authoress; &ldquo;the fairies had smeared it with
that phis,&mdash;phos,&mdash;oh, you know, that lovely
shiny stuff we saw on the sea at night when
we were in the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; shouted Max; &ldquo;lat-poison, like
they put down at the tables to kill the lats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&#8217;t,&rdquo; said Lynn angrily,&mdash;&ldquo;rat-poison
indeed,&mdash;it was like burning gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.176" id="png.176"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">166</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Pauline wearily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Su&#8217;nnly out of a snow-white lily stepped
a beautious fairy. She had&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scratch, scratch went Pauline&#8217;s pen over
a couple of pages; the fairy&#8217;s eyes were
described and likened to stars and other
shining things; her ears, her teeth, her neck,
her arms and hands were all lingeringly and
lovingly enumerated and described.</p>

<p>Max went back disgustedly to his digging
for fire.</p>

<p>Muffie nearly fell asleep, Pauline&#8217;s hand
grew cramped, and still the fairy continued
to &ldquo;have&rdquo; things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Her dress was of silver spider&#8217;s silk studded
all over with dewdrops&rsquo;,&rdquo; went on Lynn, beginning
now energetically upon every detail
of the wardrobe of the &ldquo;beautious&rdquo; being.</p>

<p>And Pauline bore even with this, though
she heaved a huge sigh of relief when from
crown to shoes the entire toilette of the fairy
had been dealt with.</p>

<p>But Lynn held her, like the ancient mariner,
with a glittering eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She was followed by six handmaidens&rsquo;,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;&lsquo;and the first one had&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But here Pauline struck. The prospect
of describing six more beauteous beings and
their toilettes was more than she could
contemplate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ve had your amount,&rdquo; she cried;
<a name="png.177" id="png.177"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">167</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>&ldquo;mine only took five pages, and I&#8217;ve done
five for you.&rdquo; And despite Lynn&#8217;s wild
entreaties, she wrote &ldquo;The End&rdquo; at this
point of the story, and shook Muffie and
informed her it was her turn.</p>

<p>Muffie yawned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oncepon a time&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Pauline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oncepon a time there was&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve got that, be quick,&rdquo; said Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oncepon a time there was a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;
Muffie looked appealingly at Lynn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fairy?&rdquo; suggested Lynn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little dog?&rdquo; said Max who had strolled
back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a little dog,&rdquo; said Muffie gratefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on, I&#8217;ve got that,&rdquo; said Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oncepon a time there was a little dog
and it&mdash;it&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was really a fairy under a enchanting
spell?&rdquo; whispered Lynn.</p>

<p>But Muffie was too sleepy to rise to the
occasion. She repeated her formula once
more in the hope of helping herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oncepon a time there was a&mdash;a dog&mdash;and
it&mdash;it&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barked?&rdquo; said Max.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Muffie thankfully. &ldquo;That&#8217;s
all, Paul&mdash;write it big, and it will make a lot.
Le&#8217;s go and see if tea&#8217;s ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.178" id="png.178"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">168</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;I haven&#8217;t lote <em>my</em> book,&rdquo; said Max, and
looked ready to cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t be so mean, Muffie; sit down and
wait,&rdquo; said Pauline. &ldquo;Come on Max, darling,
Paul will write yours the neatest of all.
Now then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Max thrust his hands into his ridiculous
pockets and stood with his legs well apart.
He always told the same class of story though
the variations were several.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;&lsquo;&#8217;was a ittle boy,
an&#8217; him said to hims mover, can I go down
in the deep foresh all by myself, an&#8217; she told
him no. And&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;here Max paused very
impressively till he had collected the eyes of
all his audience&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;he went. An&#8217; he walked
along, an&#8217; he walked along, an&#8217; he walked
along, an&#8217; he met&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;another pause, calculated
to thrill his listeners&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;a snake. An&#8217;
it clawled light up him an&#8217; it ate him all up.
Evly bit of him. Escept hims legs. An&#8217;
he walked along, an&#8217; he walked along, an&#8217;
he walked along, <ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads &#8217;an&#8217;">an&#8217;</ins> he met a tiger. An&#8217;
e tiger eat &#8217;em up. Evly bit of &#8217;em. Escept
hims feet. An&#8217; he walked along, an&#8217; he
walked along, an&#8217; he walked along, an&#8217; he
met a horsh. An&#8217; e horsh ate &#8217;em all up.
Evly bit of &#8217;em. An&#8217; nofing was left. Ony
hims button. An&#8217; hims mover had no dear
ittle boy left&rsquo;, so there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The unique part of the stories Max told
<a name="png.179" id="png.179"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">169</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>was, he invariably managed to leave the
impression that the moral of the tale was the
mother should not have refused her consent
to his going down the dark forest all alone
and that she was the sole sufferer.</p>

<p>Pauline opened and shut her cramped hand
half a dozen times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness they&#8217;re done,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Give me that piece of paper to wrap them
in, Muffie, and you go and get some string,
Lynn, while I write to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the final destination of the tales had
long since been settled.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">So it happened that Hugh Kinross, coming
home from the golf links at tea-time, was
greeted by a bulky newspaper parcel on his
desk, and the laconic note, &ldquo;Please corect
our mistakes and have them made into books
like yours, only nicer covers. We like red
except Lynn, and she likes green. And we
like gold edges and plenty of pictures, and
our names at the front in big letters.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="chap">&ldquo;OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF BABES&rdquo;</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="uc"><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;T</span>hat</span> excuse about inspiration was all
very well,&rdquo; said Dora, rubbing away
hard at an obstinate spot on a pink silk
blouse, &ldquo;but I would give a good deal to
know why he <em>really</em> went off in such a
violent hurry, Bee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I fancy he does not get on too
well with Mr. Gowan,&rdquo; said Bee. &ldquo;It always
seemed to me when I saw them together that
the one despised the other for brewing beer
and the other despised the one for brewing
books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Bee,&rdquo; said the other girl admiringly,
&ldquo;that was almost clever. I wish I
could think of that sort of thing to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must be evil communications,&rdquo; laughed
Bee. &ldquo;I never used to be accused of such a
thing as cleverness. I must tell Mr. Kinross
he&#8217;s contagious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why do you suppose he went?&rdquo;
persisted Dora. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t think he bothered
much over Mr. Gowan; he just used to avoid
him. And you can see he likes Mrs. Gowan
<a name="png.181" id="png.181"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">171</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>well enough, though I suppose not so well
as that fat sister he lives with. What <em>could</em>
have driven him away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bee, with a little iron that she heated at
a gas ring on her washstand, was carefully
smoothing out some crumpled chiffons and
ribbons.</p>

<p>For it was wet weather on the mountains,
and in the big hotel where the Gowans were
staying the two girls whom Hugh was pleased
privately to call &ldquo;little pets&rdquo; had foregathered
in Bee&#8217;s bedroom, to gossip happily
and repair little ravages in their many and
bewilderingly pretty toilettes.</p>

<p>Bee held her tiny iron against her cheek
a moment to test its heat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ve accounted for every one but
ourselves, Doady,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it must have
been one of us, or both. That is it; he likes
us both so much, and was so afraid of proposing
to the wrong one, that he dashed off
in a motor-car to consider the matter in
solitude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dora held her blouse up to the light. &ldquo;I
believe I&#8217;m making it worse,&rdquo; she said, pensively
regarding the spot. Then she poured
out a little more benzine and fell to rubbing
the place again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall you say if he proposes to you,
Bee?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bee ironed out with much deliberation the
<a name="png.182" id="png.182"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">172</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>blue chiffon hat strings that made her a joy
to all beholders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&#8217;t <em>quite</em> decided,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully;
&ldquo;I might say briskly, &lsquo;With much
pleasure, my dear Mr. Kinross.&rsquo; Or I might
put my finger in my mouth and hang back a
little time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you would accept him, Bee?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; said Bee; &ldquo;wouldn&#8217;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Dora.</p>

<p>Then both girls sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish he hadn&#8217;t started to go bald,&rdquo; Bee
said pathetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish he hadn&#8217;t started to grow stout,&rdquo;
Dora added.</p>

<p>Bee pulled herself together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charlie and Graham may be stout themselves
by the time they are his age,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Dora felt obliged to follow suit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And of course you can&#8217;t expect an author
to have as much hair as&mdash;as Charlie, for
instance, can you?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Charlie, Charlie!&rdquo; sighed Bee. &ldquo;But
what shall you say if it is <em>you</em> he wants,
Dora?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dora looked absolutely nervous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bee&mdash;tell me, for goodness&#8217; sake, so I
can be ready. Oh, I wish you could be there
to help me, if he does. I <em>know</em> I shall just
giggle.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.183" id="png.183"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">173</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;You mean &lsquo;should,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Bee calmly.
&ldquo;You know it is quite probable that it is I
he likes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, of course, Bee, you know that is
what I mean,&rdquo; said the younger girl; &ldquo;but
do tell me what to say. I should want him
to understand distinctly that I couldn&#8217;t think
of being married for ages. Oh, Bee, I must
have a bit more fun. Don&#8217;t you feel like
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, that&#8217;s all very well, Do,&rdquo; said
Bee gloomily, &ldquo;but it is quite time we were
engaged. It is a very serious matter and we
must face it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They faced it, sitting side by side on the
edge of the narrow hotel bed, with their
pretty little feet in their high-heeled shoes
dangling several inches from the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am nineteen now,&rdquo; Bee continued,
&ldquo;and I can see plainly if you don&#8217;t get
engaged by the time you are as old as that
there is very little chance for you nowadays.
Look at my sisters, four of them older than I
and not one of them engaged. And poor old
Floss is thirty-four&mdash;though of course that&#8217;s a
secret, Dora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; said Dora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&#8217;m not going to take any risks,&rdquo;
continued Bee; &ldquo;I decided that before I left
school last year. Five disengaged Miss Kings
are too frightful to contemplate. I shall not
<a name="png.184" id="png.184"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">174</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>be as particular as the girls have been; Floss
threw away one excellent chance just because
the man was only five feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bee,&rdquo; said Dora pathetically, &ldquo;of
course she did! Five feet! Why, I am five
feet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bee shook her wise head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there aren&#8217;t enough six-foot men to go
round you&#8217;ve got to put up with the five-foot
ones,&rdquo; she said inexorably. &ldquo;I have quite
decided that the first real man who asks me
I shall accept. I don&#8217;t mean silly boys like
Charlie and Graham, of course, who are only
just starting their medical course and then
have to buy a practice and make it pay before
they can marry. Why, we should have
crow&#8217;s-feet round our eyes, and thin, scraggy
necks&rdquo;&mdash;she passed a hand over her plump
young neck&mdash;&ldquo;and be left to sit out at
dances, if we waited for <em>them</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I suppose so, Bee,&rdquo; said Dora faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Dora!&rdquo; said Bee sternly, &ldquo;this
won&#8217;t do. I saw you trying to hide the
address on the envelope you posted this
morning. You&#8217;ve written another letter to
that Graham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a very short one, Bee,&rdquo; said Dora
meekly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it won&#8217;t do. Do, dear, you be
guided by me and you will live to thank me,&rdquo;
said Beatrice.</p>

<p><a name="png.185" id="png.185"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">175</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;But, Bee,&rdquo; began Dora imploringly, &ldquo;it
is not <em>quite</em> the same with me as with you,
is it? I&#8217;m only seventeen, and I&#8217;m the
eldest. Don&#8217;t you think I could have just
a little more fun?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the marvellous product of a worldly
mother and a fashionable boarding-school
shook her pretty head vigorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s every bit as serious for you, Dora,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Look at you, your father&#8217;s only
a barrister, and you know you don&#8217;t get a big
dress allowance, and there are lots of things
you can&#8217;t go to for want of money. Then
you have three sisters coming on. You owe
it to them to marry early and get out of the
way. If Floss had taken that man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The five-foot one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly&mdash;don&#8217;t be so frivolous,
Dora&mdash;I repeat if Floss had married&mdash;he was
well off and clever, and really very nice, she
owns&mdash;the chances are the other three girls
would have gone off early and been the heads
of beautiful homes to-day instead of dragging
the rounds of season after season and making
me stay up at school till I simply refused
point blank to keep my hair down another
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dora heaved a submissive sigh. Those
three chubby, pretty little sisters of hers at
home were very dear to her. And it was
true they were &ldquo;coming on;&rdquo; Amy, the eldest
<a name="png.186" id="png.186"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">176</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of them was thirteen. She would not stand
in their light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s one thing,&rdquo; she said a little more
hopefully, &ldquo;I&#8217;m sure it won&#8217;t be me&mdash;he talks
to you a lot more, Bee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s only because I talk a lot more to
him,&rdquo; said Bee, nipping the hope. &ldquo;I notice
he looks at you most.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dora gazed at herself in the glass, and the
reflection of the young rounded face and the
candid eyes and the pretty hair was so pleasing
that the instinct of conquest braced her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all, Bee,&rdquo; she said more brightly,
&ldquo;he is really <em>very</em> nice. And except when
you&#8217;re behind him you don&#8217;t notice he&#8217;s
going bald. Perhaps he&#8217;s a man you&#8217;d get to
like a good deal after you were married to
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s what I feel,&rdquo; said Bee, and added
in an extremely virtuous tone, &ldquo;if I didn&#8217;t I
should not think of him for one minute. How
girls can marry really old men or horrid men,
I simply don&#8217;t know. I think it&#8217;s just disgraceful.
But with Hugh Kinross it is <em>very</em>
different and people think a lot of you if your
husband&#8217;s an author and you get asked
<em>everywhere</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">She returned energetically to her chiffon
and twisted it in a most artistic fashion upon
a charming hat.</p>


<p class="illus pgbrk"><a name="png.187" id="png.187"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

 width="400" height="648" alt="" title="" /><br
 />&ldquo;She returned energetically to her chiffon, and twisted it
in a most artistic fashion.&rdquo;</p>


<p>Dora jumped down also from the bed and
<a name="png.189" id="png.189"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">177</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>began to collect her own belongings. Then
she stopped short one second; pretty as she
was she had a latent sense of humour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be rather funny, Bee, after all
this talk if he&#8217;d never given either of us a
serious thought,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What makes
you so sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, lots of things,&rdquo; said Miss Bee. &ldquo;Look
at the chocolates and things he brings us&mdash;and
didn&#8217;t he make Mrs. Gowan ask us to join
his party for the Caves? And look at the
things he says actually to us&mdash;that quotation,
for instance, when we were on the seat in the
summer-house,<ins class="transcriber" title="Transcriber's note:
  punctuation (and following opening quote) inserted to clarify speakers">&mdash;&rdquo;</ins></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i2">&ldquo;&lsquo;How happy could I be with either,</div>
<div class="i4">Were t&#8217;other dear charmer away!&rsquo;&rdquo;</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">murmured Dora softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and lots of things like that. A man
of his age doesn&#8217;t say them as Charlie or
Graham might. Love is a much more serious
thing with a real man than with a boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; sighed Dora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And don&#8217;t you remember what Effie
Gowan told us she had heard her mother
laughing and telling her father? That when
he asks after us he always says, &lsquo;Well,
how are the ducky little girls?&rsquo; Or else,
&lsquo;When are you going to bring the little pets
down?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.190" id="png.190"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">178</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Y-yes,&rdquo; said Dora, &ldquo;yes, I suppose he
must be serious then&mdash;as he&#8217;s not a boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Mrs. Gowan told me privately that
she really did hope Hugh would marry and
that she thought a bright young wife would
do him a world of good and get him out of all
his old-fashioned ways. Said it meaningly,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Dora, &ldquo;I had better go.
It must be nearly time to dress for dinner.
What are you going to wear, Bee?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Hugh was promptly shelved to permit
of this more important point being properly
discussed.</p>

<h3 class="chap">WOOING THE MUSE</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="uc"><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;F</span>ive</span> thousand words,&rdquo; muttered Hugh,
and then tilted back in the steady chair
he had abstracted from the kitchen for the very
purpose. Yes, this was going to be one of his
good days&mdash;he willed it so. The mood was
not there certainly, but then, now the finishing
of the book had become a pressing necessity,
the mood never was there; it was like
a tantalizing butterfly that flitted a second in
his face and then led him a desperate chase
through a tangle of undergrowth that never
ended.</p>

<p>Five thousand words! Yes, he could if
he would. Let him brace up his sinews,
summon up his blood! The mere act of
battling for it hard and earnestly would
probably bring the mood back&mdash;it had done
so many a time ere this.</p>

<p>Let him read over the last chapter or so to
get in touch again with his characters.</p>

<p>Great heavens, what balderdash it all was!
<a name="png.192" id="png.192"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">180</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>He crashed his chair on to its four legs again
and reached out blindly for his pen. And
now he scored pages and pages across with
heavy black lines; he seemed to take a
vicious pleasure after a little time in destroying
what he had written and went along with
his lips tight and a hard look in his eye,
weighing every sentence in the balance and
adjusting that balance to such nicety that
he found nearly every sentence wanting.
Out they came: occasionally a fierce black
zig-zag on the page he considered sufficient
for future deliberations, but more frequently
it needed greater physical activity to relieve
his state of mind and he ripped the page
fiercely off the block, crumpled it in his hand
and sent it flying across the room.</p>

<p>If Miss Bibby had happened in that morning
she would have come to the conclusion
that the eccentricity of genius led it to divert
itself at times with the game of paper snowballs.</p>

<p>The heavy slaughtering brought a degree
of relief; he looked over his shoulder at the
paper-strewn floor and felt a twinge of self-satisfaction:
there were authors who would
have passed the work quite complacently or
at most have considered a little polishing
was all it needed. For him it was satisfaction
or snowballs&mdash;no medium course. But then
he groaned, for his eye of a sudden fell on a
<a name="png.193" id="png.193"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">181</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>calendar. Fell on <em>the</em> calendar, to be exact.
Many of his lady friends and admirers invariably
presented him with calendars at Christmas
time (&ldquo;Such a suitable present for an
author, my dear!&rdquo;); exquisite works of art
some of them were, whose dainty strips
of ribbon, adroitly pulled, brought into
more or less perfect view the day of the
month nestling in the heart of a flower. Or
you would turn a gilded handle perhaps and a
day of the week would appear on the silver
sail of a ship, while another turn would bring
the date to the figure head and the pressing of
a spring send the name of the month fluttering
as a flag on the top of the mast. Hugh
had a sincere admiration for this ingenious
trifle, and frequently when a hero was behaving
untowardly idly amused himself with
spinning up the signs.</p>

<p>But of course, if one really wanted to
know the date one looked at the plainest one
had: this year it happened to be a gratis one,
presented with the advertisement pamphlets
of some patent medicine, and it had stood
Hugh in good stead from January to now,
when November&#8217;s cloud of heat clung closely
to the mountains.</p>

<p>But the sight of it caused him to groan and
to realize that the just passed Berserk mood
had cost him perhaps seven thousand words;
and the seven thousand words represented
<a name="png.194" id="png.194"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">182</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>all the work he had done up here at &ldquo;Tenby&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Tenby&rdquo;
that he had taken expressly for the
performance of doughty deeds of literature.</p>

<p>He looked ruefully at his snowballs;&mdash;perhaps
after all he had been hypercritical,
perhaps one or two of those pages might be
rescued and smoothed out and made to
answer. After all, who else would be the
better or the worse for it? All the public
wanted of him was a piquant flavour for its
jaded appetite and the details on which he
bestowed such a fever of care would probably
escape its attention altogether. Yes, after
all, what was he? Just the paid provider of
certain species of mental refreshment,&mdash;a sort
of fashionable drink that the hurrying public,
coming along and seeing others drinking, took
a gulp at and went on with its much more
important work nor better nor worse for the
quaff. Why, an orange boy, selling his honest
juicy fruit to a thirsty crowd was a better
public benefactor than himself! Pah! he
had been over-estimating himself of late;
he was not of the authors who might legitimately
claim to refresh and stimulate the race
to higher things. He was just a maker of
&ldquo;bitters,&rdquo; and the public, in its charmingly
inscrutable fashion, declaring for it as its
favourite beverage for the moment, he had
become &ldquo;popular.&rdquo; Why worry himself ill
over the concoction of the bitters; sharp and
<a name="png.195" id="png.195"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">183</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>strong that was all it asked? Yes, yes, those
snowballs on the floor were quite good enough,
let him pick them up and uncrumple them and
pin them back in their places ready for the
typewriter.</p>

<p>But Kate came in,&mdash;Kate in one of her
fresh-looking pin-spot print frocks. She
seemed to exhale something clean, wholesome,
stimulating, though she spoke no word and
only laid the morning letters down beside him
and, when he looked round at her, gave him her
cheery smile.</p>

<p>He clutched at her plump, print-covered
arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the love of heaven, K,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;pick all that paper up off the floor and take
it away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kate gave him the soothing hand-stroke
that nurses keep for feverish patients.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;certainly, straight
away, old boy.&rdquo; She groped about beneath
his knees for the wastepaper basket that
would be needed as vehicle.</p>

<p>Then he heard her breathing a little hard
as she stooped here, there and everywhere for
the snowballs.</p>

<p>He did not turn round, but talked during her
labours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s not etiquette I know, girl,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I wouldn&#8217;t dare to present a hero to the
public who let a woman pick up her own
<a name="png.196" id="png.196"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">184</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>handkerchief. But I always was a cowardly chap,
wasn&#8217;t I? You remember the time I took
Jack&#8217;s licking at school because I knew if I
turned round and let him see it was the wrong
fellow, the master would notice my cheek
was puffed out with toothache and send me
straight off to the dentist&#8217;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember,&rdquo; said Kate, puffing and
panting cheerfully about the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, old girl,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In a second
I shan&#8217;t be able to restrain myself from clutching
some of that stuff back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&#8217;s genuinely bad?&rdquo; said Kate,
working hard: you might have imagined her
engaged in gathering mushrooms at so much
a minute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The scum of literary abomination,&rdquo;
groaned Hugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&#8217;re certain you&#8217;re not deceiving
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, perhaps I am,&rdquo; he said swinging
round, &ldquo;y-y-yes, I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s good
enough. Seven thousand words, K, seven
thousand p-p-precious words&mdash;human nature
won&#8217;t stand it, will it? Let me have another
look at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But now Kate was adamant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good enough is not good enough for
Hugh Kinross,&rdquo; she said sternly and made
straight off to the kitchen fire with the overflowing
basket clasped firmly in her arms.</p>

<p><a name="png.197" id="png.197"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">185</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>And now Hugh heaved a sigh of relief and
settled down in better heart to his work.
He took out a fresh writing-block and firmly
and with inspiring assurance inscribed upon it
the number of his chapter.</p>

<p>But after regarding this effort with an uplifted
look for a second or two his eye fell upon
the letters beside him that Kate had laid
down.</p>

<p>Now there is something insidiously insistent
about the morning post when one is away
from all the other corrupting effects of the
civilization of cities.</p>

<p>Hugh knew perfectly well that he was
trembling on the verge of his precipice when
he let his eye linger upon the envelopes;
he knew perfectly well that the act of opening
one would send his already nearly maddened
Muse clean out of the window for the rest of
the morning. But yet he dallied.</p>

<p>It was more than possible that there was
a highly important letter there, and two or
three hours&#8217; delay in opening would mean a
serious loss. His last story, for instance, that
his London agent was serializing in several
countries&mdash;yes, it was quite possible some
instant information was wanted about it.
Or that tale he had offered to an American
magazine&mdash;probably there was news about it
here; it was a decent story too, he would like
to find out if it had been appreciated. And
<a name="png.198" id="png.198"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">186</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>then there were those shares he had taken in
that Transvaal concern, suppose news had
come of a fall or rise in them? He would
not listen to the cold-headed remembrance
that whispered that no English, nor American,
nor African mail was due to-day. It was
perfectly possible that in an undermanned
country post office like this these important
letters had been left over since last mail and
only just delivered. It was really highly
important that he should make sure.</p>

<p>He drew the little stack of envelopes
towards him and tilted comfortably back
while he opened them.</p>

<p>He owed his tailor thirteen pounds eleven
and six, he discovered. He discovered that by
employing the Reliance Carpet Company his
Axminster carpets would be entirely freed
from dust and in such a way that he need
fear no microbes for his nursery.</p>

<p>The Mission to the Chinese of Wexford
Street, and Lower George Street, would be
glad of a subscription from him, he learnt.</p>

<p>A Consumptive Hospital, a Crêche for
Neglected Infants, a Convalescent Home, an
Inebriates&#8217; Retreat all had a similar use for
him. While slightly more cheerful, if less
urgently necessary methods of spending his
money were suggested by requests, (1) to take
a few five-shilling tickets for a concert for the
purpose of sending a deserving young singer
<a name="png.199" id="png.199"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">187</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to Italy; (2) to purchase at a reduction a calf-bound
set of the <cite>Encyclop&aelig;dia Cosmopolitana</cite>
with which the owner, being short of money,
was reluctantly compelled to part, and which
he, as an author, would doubtless find it to his
benefit to acquire; (3) to be present at the
banquet of a fellow author, departing for the
old country, tickets one guinea. Then there
was one typewriting lady who offered to do
his work at so much a thousand words, and
submitted a sample of her work. And another
typewriting lady, who submitted no
sample, stated that reverses of fortune had
driven her from a high position in the best
society to the bitter one of a typist, and she
was therefore compelled to solicit his work to
enable her to keep herself.</p>

<p>It was quite a pleasant change to discover
two people merely wanted his autograph.
&ldquo;Dear sir, I am collecting autographs and
have 637; will you please send yours by
return post as I enclose a stamp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She encloses a stamp,&rdquo; murmured Hugh
admiringly.</p>

<p>The other seeker accompanied her request
with a perfervid letter of praise about his
work, but on the heavy autograph album that
accompanied the letter he noticed Kate had
had to pay tenpence deficient postage and
there were no stamps enclosed for the return
of the precious volume.</p>

<p><a name="png.200" id="png.200"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">188</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>A jeweller&#8217;s catalogue provided a few
minutes&#8217; lighter reading, and its diamond
rings and its pearl and diamond necklets
and pendants and brooches were so temptingly
illustrated, that they awoke the present-giving
instinct in the man&#8217;s heart and he
revolved the question whether etiquette would
permit him to give Dora and Beatrice a
necklet apiece for their pretty necks and
Miss Bibby a chaste brooch. Kate, he reluctantly
remembered, cared nothing for jewellery.</p>

<p>But it was upon the last opened missive
he wasted most of his time,&mdash;possibly because
it was the last and Chapter eleven looked
large on the horizon again.</p>

<p>It was an advertisement of enamel paint
and was accompanied by a most pleasing
picture of a gentleman in a frock coat and
a lady in a most complicated costume,
delicately engaged in making &ldquo;better than
new,&rdquo; by the aid of this enamel paint, a whole
bedroom suite.</p>

<p>Something in the elegant <i>négligé</i> of the
attitude of the gentleman in the frockcoat
depicted pensively painting the bedstead
stimulated Hugh marvellously.</p>

<p>He felt an insane desire to get a pot of the
famous paint and set to work himself upon a
similar labour.</p>

<p>Kate came gently across the floor and placed
<a name="png.201" id="png.201"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">189</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>a jug of iced lemon water and a tumbler at
his elbow.</p>

<p>She was about to withdraw in perfect
silence, but he detained her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kate,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Her most motherly look was on her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, dear lad?&rdquo; she said, for her
heart was full of futile sympathy for his
straits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kate,&rdquo; he said yearningly. &ldquo;Do you
think Larkin could get me a pot of Perfect
Perfection Enamel warranted to dry in ten
minutes, all colours kept in stock? If I can&#8217;t
enamel a bedstead this very minute I won&#8217;t
answer for my reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kate walked deliberately across the room
and boxed his ears.</p>

<h3 class="chap">LITERATURE IS LOW</h3>


<p class="first"><span>But</span> after half an hour&#8217;s further struggle he
got up and drifted aimlessly out of the
room, finally bringing up in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Kate was here concocting a savoury and an
<i>entrée</i> and two or three other things for his
dinner, for she had packed the depressed and
depressing Ellen off to the bakers&#8217; picnic with
Anna from &ldquo;Greenways&rdquo; and was sole mistress
of her hearth and home for the day.</p>

<p>Here she was when her brother found her,
covered up in a spotless apron and, with
sleeves rolled engagingly back over her plump
white arms, energetically pounding up some
anchovies. Hugh sat down heavily on the
edge of the dresser.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A writer&#8217;s a miserable beast, K,&rdquo; he said
dejectedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it up to-day, boy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
can see you can&#8217;t help yourself. Go for a
walk,&mdash;go and look up the little pets. Or
have a romp with the children across the road.
<a name="png.203" id="png.203"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">191</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Don&#8217;t break your back to-day over a load
that another day you will snap your fingers
at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took no notice of her suggestions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you deny that it is a miserable trade?
A womanish sort of business? You sit
twiddling your pen, your nerves so a-stretch
that if a door bangs the mood shuts down on
you for the day. And there&#8217;s that fellow
across the road swinging away with his axe
among the trees just as he has been ever since
breakfast. He&#8217;ll leave off presently and boil
his billy and eat his bread and cheese and
have his smoke, and then back he&#8217;ll go to
his work. There it is spread out straight
before him, and the muscles on his arms&mdash;have
you ever noticed the fellow&#8217;s muscles?&mdash;tell
him that he is equal to it. Do you ever see <em>him</em>
pacing distractedly about, wondering if the
mood will come to him? Do you ever see
<em>him</em> sitting dejectedly twiddling his axe, and
rendered quite incapable because he has been
interrupted at a critical time and put out of
vein? I tell you, my girl, that fellow&#8217;s a
man, and I&#8217;d like to go out and shake hands
with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And doubtless,&rdquo; said Kate, hastily sprinkling
coral pepper over her savouries, &ldquo;doubtless
every time that fine fellow stops to wipe
his beaded brow, he glances over here to envy
a man who has nothing to do but sit in a
<a name="png.204" id="png.204"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">192</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>comfortable chair in the shade and scribble
any nonsense that comes into his head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, why,&rdquo; said Hugh addressing the
rows of plates ranged beside him, &ldquo;why does
a woman feel it her bounden duty to clap
down with a conventional remark like that
every time a man lets off a little steam?
Besides I deny it,&mdash;the chair is <em>not</em> comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kate gave a sidelong glance at the clock
and began to chop parsley as if against time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;I will <em>not</em> take the hint,
my good woman. I hold you with my glittering
eye and listen to me you shall. &lsquo;Litteratoor
is low&rsquo;,&mdash;Artemus Ward says so. Worse
than that it&#8217;s no longer exclusive,&mdash;Mr. Dooley
maintains that it is not. Do you remember
the verse and chapter, madam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something about turning Miranda into
authoreen does her skirt sag,&rdquo; murmured
Kate.</p>

<p>Hugh held up a hand commanding silence
and rolled out his Irish with gusto: &ldquo;&lsquo;Th&#8217;
longer th&#8217; wurruld lasts th&#8217; more books does
be comin&#8217; out. They&#8217;s a publisher in ivry
block an&#8217; in thousands iv happy homes some
wan is plugging away at th&#8217; romantic novel
or whalin&#8217; out a pome on th&#8217; typewriter
upstairs. A fam&#8217;ly without an author is as
contemptible as wan without a priest. Is
Malachi near-sighted, peevish, averse to th&#8217;
<a name="png.205" id="png.205"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">193</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>suds, an&#8217; can&#8217;t tell whether th&#8217; three in th&#8217;
front yard is blue or green? Make an author
iv him! Does Miranda prisint no attraction
to the young men iv th&#8217; neighbourhood, does
her over-skirt dhrag an&#8217; is she poor with th&#8217;
gas range? Make an authoreen iv her!&rsquo;
That&#8217;s it, Kit, it&#8217;s a poor sort of life at best,
no manliness about it. Picture the contrast,
girl&mdash;those fine fellows who stood at attention
by their gun at Colenso when it was all up
with them, and your blessed brother tinkering
away at a pink and white muslin heroine
that never was on land or sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, but, but,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;you can&#8217;t
have a world made up of axemen and fine
soldiers. It seems to me Nature has made a
use for your contemptible authors in letting
them inspire others to fine deeds. Those men
at Colenso, for instance,&mdash;I grant you it <em>was</em>
a fine thing to do, to stand at attention while
awaiting death. But I believe if such a
thing ever could have been inquired into
with the minuteness that the Psychic Research
Society brings to bear upon the problems
that confront it, it would have been found that
something far back in the minds of one or
more of the three, some fine deed in a book,
some shining act witnessed on a stage, gave
the cue for the act at which the civilized
world thundered applause.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a pretty notion,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;and a
<a name="png.206" id="png.206"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">194</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>kind one to a writer sunk in a slough of despond.
But I hae ma doots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&#8217;t,&rdquo; said Kate stoutly. &ldquo;In
point of fact I truly believe that one half of
our actions&mdash;especially our better ones&mdash;spring
from an unconscious desire to be like
or unlike some character of some book or
play. Where a sincere Christian struggles
desperately to live like Christ of the Great
Book, the less courageous aim lower and substitute
a panorama of book characters that
shift with their stages of growth. Many a
meanness of life is left uncommitted, not solely
because it is a meanness but because it would
look execrable in the pages of a novel. Why,
only for being terrorized by the Old Maid of
Fiction, I&#8217;d be keeping a cat and a parrot
myself by this time, Hugh Kinross, and you
know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what should I be doing?&rdquo; asked
Hugh, amused.</p>

<p>Kate cogitated for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would have been an Egoist, only
Meredith made you ashamed to be one,&rdquo; she
answered.</p>

<p>Hugh nodded approval at her hit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&#8217;m still a posturing, narrow-living
ass, ain&#8217;t I?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;like the rest of the
writing tribe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Kate comfortably, &ldquo;of course
one hates an author that&#8217;s all author&mdash;how
<a name="png.207" id="png.207"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">195</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>does it go? fellows in foolscap uniforms
turned up with ink? But you&#8217;re not that
sort, Hughie. I will say for you that when
you haven&#8217;t the pen in your hand you are
just plain man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, old girl,&rdquo; said Hugh, grateful for
a moment. But then he soon drooped again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, the trail of the serpent is over
the artistic temperament, Kit. Look at me,&mdash;if
I get into a company where I&#8217;m pointed
out, <i>monstrari digito</i>, as Hugh Kinross,
I&#8217;m bored&mdash;and no doubt show that I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&#8217;ve often noticed that,&rdquo; said Kate,
who had long secretly considered this rather
a noble trait in her brother&#8217;s character.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hugh pensively, &ldquo;and then
when I get into a company where no one
knows me from Smith the chemist&#8217;s clerk, a
childish resentment comes over me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried Kate.</p>

<p>It was not Hugh&#8217;s pettiness that called
forth the exclamation, but the saddening
circumstance that she had put her chopped
and seasoned parsley into the sweet mixture
that represented the pudding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How,&rdquo; she asked pathetically, &ldquo;can I
get ready to feed a lion when it gets under my
feet all the time like this? Is there <em>nothing</em>
you can do? Couldn&#8217;t you go and play wild
beasts under the piano for a little time? Max
and Muffie would help you growl.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.208" id="png.208"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">196</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Hugh abandoned the dresser which rattled
ominously as he took his solid weight off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Max and Muffie remind me of Miss Bibby,
and Miss Bibby reminds me of a duty to be
performed,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&#8217;ve promised to read
her story. Well, if England expects every
man this day to do his duty, Australia may
expect duty this day to do a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">Kate heard him going heavily back to his
study.</p>

 /></span>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3 class="chap">AN EDITING PENCIL</h3>


<p class="first"><span>And</span> now he swept all his own work out of
the way and, sitting firmly down once
more upon his chair from the kitchen, spread
out upon his time-be desk, Miss Bibby&#8217;s MS.</p>

<p>He had read it through no less than three
times.</p>

<p>At the first reading he had laughed, indeed
he had leaned back in his chair and fairly
yelled with laughing.</p>

<p>For he could so plainly recognize his own
influence, and the incongruity of it against
the gentle, colourless background of the tale
was in truth amusing. A more ludicrous
effect could hardly have been obtained, if
Miss Bibby herself, clad in the limp lavender
muslin, had been encountered lashing about
with a stockwhip or hurling blue metal wildly
in all directions.</p>

<p>But then he sobered himself with an effort
and read the tale again. And this time a
hopeless look settled upon his face. It would
<a name="png.210" id="png.210"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">198</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>have been so pleasant, so easy to praise
warmly, point out a trifling error or two and
so have done with his self-imposed task.</p>

<p>But it was so plain, so very plain that the
woman could not write,&mdash;would never write.
Her characters were paper dolls and lay on
the typed sheets as flat as paper dolls. No
breath of air, of motion, was in all the tale.
No glint of humour, no suspicion of literary
grace, not one even faintly original observation
made it possible for him to hope there
might be any promise of success before
the woman. Stereotyped characters talking
stereotyped talk and working out a thin
stereotyped little plot, such was the hopeless
material before him, while here and there
on the dull grey of it, like patches of amazing
scarlet clumsily stitched on, were cutting
phrases and sardonic observations closely
imitated from <cite>Liars All</cite>.</p>

<p>He tossed the stuff aside impatiently after
the second reading and shot an indignant
glance through the window at &ldquo;Greenways.&rdquo;
But &ldquo;Greenways&rdquo; only showed dimly through
a mist that was rolling through the garden,
so imagination had to call up the offending
figure of the would-be authoress. And call
her up it did,&mdash;kindly tender imagination!
It flashed two glimpses of her before Hugh&#8217;s
eyes, one as she knelt on the path and dragged
at a child&#8217;s obstinate shoe biting her lips while
<a name="png.211" id="png.211"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">199</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the marauding ants ran up her own sleeves.
And the other as she faced him, white-cheeked
against the ruddy waratahs, and told him she
&ldquo;preferred to talk of the New Zealand
Terraces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew the poor MS towards him again
and glanced through it once more desperately.</p>

<p>Then he took off his coat as a signal of
earnest determination and filled his pen
afresh and pulled a sheaf of paper towards
him and settled down to see what might be
done.</p>

<p>Two hours later he was still battling with
it. He told himself it was his expiation. He
had galvanized a few of the paper dolls into
something a little resembling life, had put a
dash of humour here and there and in some
slight degree strengthened the plot. All this
by putting in slips between the pages or by
writing in the margin. But it was still a
sorry story.</p>

<p>He stood up, yawned relievedly and went
to the window. &ldquo;Greenways&rdquo; was smiling in
the sunshine now as if it had never had such
a garden guest as mist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear lady,&rdquo; he said&mdash;he had a habit
of thinking aloud when he was alone like
this&mdash;&ldquo;that is not a kind action I have done
you, though you will probably thank me
profusely. You can&#8217;t always be edited like
this, and even with all this assistance you
<a name="png.212" id="png.212"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">200</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>won&#8217;t have the least idea how the thing is
done. As the Snark said,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div>&lsquo;The method employed I would gladly explain,</div>
<div class="i4">While I have it so clear in my head,</div>
<div>If I had but the time and you had but the brain&mdash;</div>
<div class="i4">But yet much remains to be said.&rsquo;</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Anyway I&#8217;ve done my best to atone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kate came in with a telegram in her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And have you sixpence about you?&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Of course it&#8217;s not in Larkin&#8217;s day&#8217;s
work to deliver telegrams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not&mdash;officially. But your telegram
would lie on the little counter of the post
office for a whole day waiting for you to
chance in&mdash;unless Larkin looked to the matter.
So he used to pop his red head in at the post-office
door, whenever he was near, just to
ascertain if there were a blue envelope lying
there for one of his clients. And if there
were, that client was in possession of it in a
few minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By George, K,&mdash;I&#8217;ve got to catch the
one-thirty,&rdquo; said Hugh, and he strode this
way across his little room and then that way,
and knocked a chair over, and seized hold
of his coat and began to struggle into it, and
still seemed no farther on his way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&mdash;don&#8217;t get excited, old fellow,&rdquo;
said Kate, &ldquo;I&#8217;ll manage it,&mdash;no, never mind
that coat, you can&#8217;t travel in it. Shall I
<a name="png.213" id="png.213"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">201</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>pack your bag for only one day or longer?&rdquo;
Hugh read the message again, but it did
not seem to help him with the amount of
clothing he would need; indeed it merely
sent his thoughts off at a tangent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; Kate said briskly, &ldquo;a few
extra things won&#8217;t be in the way. Now see
here, Hugh, go in and shave, I&#8217;ll bring your
hot water, then dress, your brown suit and
your new Panama&mdash;I wonder where your
travelling cap is? No need to get flurried,
you can have twenty minutes to dress and
then take a comfortable half-hour for lunch.
Larkin&#8217;s here, luckily; I can send him for a
wagonette, so you won&#8217;t have to waste
time walking to the station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hugh felt his chin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I must shave? I shouldn&#8217;t
meet any one by this train.&rdquo; He looked at her
anxiously for indulgence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly you must,&rdquo; she said severely,
and then he knew there was no hope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want any of this with you?&rdquo;
she added, nodding across to his paper-strewn
table, &ldquo;or shall I put it all in a safe
place till you come back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, by Jove,&rdquo; he said,&mdash;&ldquo;yes, there&#8217;s
that short story of mine, &lsquo;Fools of Fortune&rsquo;&mdash;I&#8217;ve
promised that for the <cite>Melbourne Review</cite>,
it ought to have been posted last night.
And then there&#8217;s that woman&#8217;s stuff&mdash;I
<a name="png.214" id="png.214"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">202</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>suppose there&#8217;s no time for me to run across
to Miss Bibby, eh, K?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly there is not,&rdquo; said Kate decisively,
&ldquo;you don&#8217;t stir from here without a
comfortable lunch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;see here, K, I&#8217;ll
leave her stuff here on the desk in this envelope,
and you take it over to her and tell her
I think if she goes more on these lines the
tale will be stronger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;and what about
the other tale,&mdash;the one for the <cite>Melbourne
Review</cite>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hugh hastily stuffed some more MS into an
envelope, wrote a few lines to accompany it,
and scribbled an address.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See it is posted at once,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&#8217;ve
addressed it to Miss Brown, and told her to
type it and to post it on to the <cite>Review</cite>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m sure I could start again,&rdquo; said Kate,
&ldquo;let me do it as usual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But a slight eye trouble she had suffered
from lately had made Hugh lock his sister&#8217;s
machine for the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t waste time talking,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;just send it to the post as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;Larkin can
take it with him. Now go and shave <em>instantly</em>
and, remember&mdash;your <em>brown</em> suit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All was managed so well that Hugh had
nearly ten minutes to spare after lunch in
<a name="png.215" id="png.215"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">203</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>which to smoke and luxuriate in the knowledge
that all was well with him, his bag
properly packed, his cap in his pocket, his
flask filled, and money for the journey in the
pocket of the suit on his back instead of in the
one dangling in his wardrobe as had occurred
before this, when Kate had not been there.</p>

<p>He looked at her gratefully. She was as
good-tempered as ever; not in the least
flustered or put out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jove, K,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should be a fool to
marry. For real solid satisfaction give me
a sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Kate amusedly. &ldquo;Do you
think your wife wouldn&#8217;t pack your bag for
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He considered Bee for a moment in a
wifely, packing attitude, then Dora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not all wives,&rdquo; he said a little vaguely.
&ldquo;At all events they&#8217;d pout and worry to
know why I was going and what the horrid
telegram was about, and when was I coming
back, and where was I going to stay&mdash;and
so on till the train was lost. And look at
you&mdash;not a word!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I should have asked you fast enough&mdash;when
you came back,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;and
that is the same thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, faith, it&#8217;s not, Kate; I&#8217;d have had
leisure to invent my own account by that
time,&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>

<p><a name="png.216" id="png.216"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">204</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;next time I
shall pout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hugh struck a match.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can tell you now, as there&#8217;s time. I
felt I wasn&#8217;t making money fast enough by
books for our old age, K, and I&#8217;ve been speculating
a bit. It&#8217;s helped to worry me and
keep me from work lately. But the shares
are rising and I&#8217;m going down to be on the
spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the wagonette drove up and he
seized his bag and his hat, and Kate ran after
him to the gate with his pipe.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">When Miss Bibby heard from the children
that he had gone away, she sighed deeply.
And at night when the little ones were all
asleep, and Anna, her face smeared with
Pauline&#8217;s sunburn cream, her hair damp
with the preparation bought to improve
Muffie&#8217;s thin hair, and her teeth ashine with
the family tooth powder, was on her way to
bed, and the mist had crept up to the windows
and wrapped everything in its eerie shroud,
Miss Bibby sighed again.</p>

<h3 class="chap">MAX RUNS AMUCK</h3>


<p class="first"><span>Greenways</span> was overwhelmed with
horror. It felt it ought to draw a veil
of mist round its face and shrink from the
public gaze instead of standing there brazenly
smiling as usual amid its trees and flowers
and pretending it was the abode of innocence
and content.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby was extremely upset, sufficiently
so to be nearly helpless in the crisis.
The little girls whispered together with horrified
and excited eyes and more than inclined
to a theory that nothing short of a cable to
New Zealand recalling their parents could
adequately deal with the present situation.</p>

<p>Anna, who had quarrelled with her baker,
said she was not in the least surprised, for
men and boys were all the same, downright
black at heart.</p>

<p>But Max stood fast in his iniquity.</p>

<p>Max, four-year old Max&mdash;whose &ldquo;trousers&rdquo;
<a name="png.218" id="png.218"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">206</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>did not measure three inches in the
inner seam of the leg&mdash;Max, who was not yet
entirely initiated into the difficulties of speech,
had broken forth into &ldquo;language!&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one knew where he could have possibly
heard the hair-raising phrase. Certainly
there was the gardener, Blake, about the
premises who, being of the downright black-hearted
sex, might have let fall the words
Max had evidently garnered and laid by with
such care and accuracy until occasion offered.</p>

<p>But he was so surly and monosyllabic a
man that the children gave him the widest
of berths, and therefore that theory was
unlikely.</p>

<p>Anna aspersed the character of Larkin.
A boy with hair that colour, she maintained,
must be subject to periodical explosions, and
it was probably during one of them that Max
had secreted his bit of dynamite. But the
little girls gave Larkin the warmest testimonials.
In all the time they had known
him he had never been guilty of anything
stronger than &ldquo;My jiggery!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It all began with a bib at breakfast time.</p>

<p>When Anna would have tied it around
Max&#8217;s neck, as she or some other person in
her position had done for years, he jerked his
head suddenly aside. &ldquo;Take it away,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, darling,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby, who
<a name="png.219" id="png.219"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">207</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>was serving out the porridge, &ldquo;you must
have your bib on; don&#8217;t be naughty. Look,
it&#8217;s the pretty one with Jack Sprat on it.
Tie it on, Anna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Max ducked skilfully just as Anna brought
the tapes together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just look at &#8217;im,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Max,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby,
&ldquo;you don&#8217;t want to spoil that pretty coat
with your porridge. Why, it&#8217;s your new coat
with a pocket in! Let Anna tie it now,
quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Anna essayed her task. Max held
still till the square of huckaback portraying
the economic existence of Jack Sprat and
his wife was well beneath his chin, and the
tapes gathered once more up into Anna&#8217;s
hands.</p>

<p>Then he gave a movement like a plunging
horse, seized the offending article and flung
it with all his force across the table where it
fell and floated upon the milk Muffie had
poured over her porridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Anna,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby, &ldquo;take
the bib away and you need not wait. Master
Max does not want any breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was quite true, for Master Max had
quite satisfied his morning appetite by a
surreptitious ten minutes at the mulberry
tree while the three little girls were having
their hair brushed.</p>

<p><a name="png.220" id="png.220"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">208</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Can I go?&rdquo; he said eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean, may I?&rdquo; Miss Bibby said
mechanically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, may I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. You will sit quite still
as a gentleman should when ladies are still
eating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Max cast a lowering glance at the ladies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, make her hurry,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;look
at her taking anover lot of leam.&rdquo; He glared
at Muffie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall take six lots of cream, if I choose,&rdquo;
said Muffie. &ldquo;I&#8217;ve got to put something on
to take away the taste of your horrid dirty
bib.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a clean one, Muffie, or I should
have passed you a fresh plateful,&rdquo; said Miss
Bibby; &ldquo;at the same time that does not
excuse Max for his ill-behaviour. Max, before
I can overlook your conduct you must
apologize to Muffie and to Anna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Muffie looked important; she rather enjoyed
being apologized to.</p>

<p>Max sat very square on the big books of
his chair; possibly their presence beneath
him encouraged his rebellion by reminding
him that until he took a firm stand against
it a month or two ago a high chair had been
considered fitted to his dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve done wiv bibs,&rdquo; he announced, and
he looked the whole table fairly in the face.</p>

<p><a name="png.221" id="png.221"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">209</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Pauline and Muffie and Lynn giggled a
little. They had begun to recognize vaguely
that Max was not exactly as they were.</p>

<p>When he stood with his little legs planted
far apart and his little hands thrust deep in
his knickerbocker pockets, and his little head
cocked on one side, some subtle breath of a
spirit, masculine and essentially opposed to
their own, was wafted towards them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve done wiv bibs,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do, Max,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby,
coldly. &ldquo;I shall consider you in disgrace,
until you have told Anna and Muffie you are
sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve done wiv bibs,&rdquo; shouted Max.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go and stand in that corner, Max,&rdquo; Miss
Bibby said with unexpected sternness in her
tone.</p>

<p>Max scrambled off his chair as if he could
hardly reach the place indicated fast enough.</p>

<p>He ran right into the corner&mdash;gave a hard
kick at the skirting board and made a rush
for the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve done wiv bibs,&rdquo; he shrieked, and
tore away as fast as his legs could carry him
into the garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on with your breakfast, Lynn,&rdquo; said
Miss Bibby with as much calmness as she
could muster,&mdash;&ldquo;sit down immediately,
Muffie&mdash;&rdquo; for Muffie, excited by the unusual
happening, had flown to the window to see
<a name="png.222" id="png.222"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">210</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>where the rebel was heading for, &ldquo;Max has
forgotten himself, I am afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was ever Miss Bibby&#8217;s phrase&mdash;ever
her gentle optimism. If you lost your temper,
your manners, your courage, any of your
higher qualities, you had &ldquo;forgotten yourself,&rdquo;
forgotten the fine, upright man you
were by nature and become for a moment the
shadowy ghost of that black unknown self
that ever dogs one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I have finished, I will ask you to
excuse me, little girls,&rdquo; Miss Bibby continued,
rising from her seat. In point of fact, she
had not yet consumed the whole of her
slender meal, but who was to say what a boy
with such a red, fierce little face might be
doing?</p>

<p>She crossed the grass with troubled eyes.
Max was too busy a little man to have fits
like this often.</p>

<p>Now and again in wet weather, certainly,
when he could not work off any superfluous
steam in the garden, he had lately taken to
flinging himself flat on the floor and kicking,
if thwarted in any way. And Miss Bibby
had vaguely recognized that this was due to
his being deprived so long of the healthy
moral tone of the presence of his mother and
father&mdash;the latter in especial.</p>

<p>Anna opined that the easiest way to get
him out of these &ldquo;tantrums&rdquo; was to bribe
<a name="png.223" id="png.223"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">211</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>him with the offer of a large piece of
chocolate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&#8217;s only a baby,&rdquo; she would say excusingly,
&ldquo;and besides, he&#8217;s a boy&mdash;it&#8217;s in him
and it&#8217;s got to come out,&mdash;same as a measle
rash. You&#8217;d think there&#8217;d be some med&#8217;cin
for it, wouldn&#8217;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kinross would have enjoyed the notion&mdash;the
need of a Tonic for Eliminating the Black
Corpuscles from the Blood of Boys.</p>

<p>Max saw Miss Bibby coming. In truth
he had almost forgotten his recent revolt
against law and order, for during his tumultuous
passage through the garden, he had
come across one of the guinea-pigs that had
escaped from its bondage. An exciting chase
had followed, but he had won, and in the
satisfaction consequent upon victory he might
have even been induced to overlook Miss
Bibby&#8217;s behaviour.</p>

<p>But then he saw the gentle reproach in her
eyes, and noted (the Judge himself had not
the faculty of lightning observation possessed
by his son) the nervous, half-conciliatory
trepidation of her manner. He thrust his
hands as deeply as they would go into his inadequate
pockets and met her gaze unblinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Maxie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I can&#8217;t believe
this is the good little boy who was here yesterday.
No, it is some other bad little fellow
who has taken his suit and looks like him.
<a name="png.224" id="png.224"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">212</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Do you think if I look carefully about I could
find my good little boy again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Max would have none of such folly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m me,&rdquo; he said determinedly.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby sought to gather him up in her
arms&mdash;the natural instinct. For indeed when
your rebel&#8217;s &ldquo;trousers&rdquo; measure but three
inches in the inner seam you cannot regard
him as other than a baby.</p>

<p>But he held fast to the wire fence of the
guinea-pigs&#8217; run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>won&#8217;t</em> be nursed,&rdquo; he said. She stood
ten minutes cajoling him, wheedling, coaxing,
threatening. No, he would not return to his
corner and work out his punishment, even
though the punisher was eagerly offering to
reduce the duration of it to &ldquo;exactly three
minutes, Max darling,&mdash;see, by this pretty
little watch, and then we can all be friends
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No, Max would have no traffic at all in the
offer of such an ignominious position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, see here, Max,&rdquo; said the helpless
lady recognizing and bowing at last to the
stronger will, &ldquo;if I let you off the corner will
you run in and kiss Muffie and Anna to show
you are sorry?&rdquo; (The word &ldquo;apologize&rdquo;
was eliminated now from this last treaty<ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original has period outside parenthesis">.)</ins></p>

<p>No, Max would <em>not</em> kiss either Anna or
Muffie. They were both &ldquo;bad girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Max,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby, &ldquo;you
<a name="png.225" id="png.225"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">213</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>only leave me one resort. I shall shut you
up until you are good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can run licker than you,&rdquo; was Max&#8217;s
reply, and he ducked beneath her arm and
dashed across the garden.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby&#8217;s blood rose high and she
started to follow him. But how may a lady
who for at least twenty years has done
nothing but walk sedately ever expect or
wildly hope to catch up a pair of brown
muscular little legs? She was brought up
panting, with her hand at her side before
they had circled the bamboos three times and
the quarry was plainly as fresh as ever. But:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div>&ldquo;Escape me never, beloved,</div>
<div>While I am I and you are you.&rdquo;</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">was Miss Bibby&#8217;s attitude now. She called
to Anna to help with the chase. And Anna
came cheerfully as well as of necessity, for
Max had crushed mulberries on her snowy
kitchen table, in an endeavour to &ldquo;invent
cochineal,&rdquo; and it would take her hours to
eradicate the stain.</p>

<p>The little girls came too&mdash;they felt it was
more than half a game, for Max&#8217;s face was
perfectly smiling and good-natured.</p>

<p>So Pauline stood guard at the waratahs,
and Lynn and Anna prevented any more
dodging at the bamboos, and Miss Bibby cut
<a name="png.226" id="png.226"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">214</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>off the retreat to the house and Muffie worried
him in the rear.</p>

<p>Surely, surely by tactics like these they
drove him right into a corner. Had there
been a fence he would have shown fight a
little longer by scrambling up it and continuing
the chase on the other side. But they
had headed him to a hedge, an African box
thorn hedge, and there was nothing more to
be done. So he stuck his legs apart, and put
his hands in his pockets and surveyed his
captors as they closed in round him. And
it seemed satisfactory to his self-respect that
it had taken five of them&mdash;two quite grown-up,
too&mdash;to beat him.</p>

<p>But Anna was singularly without the
capacity for admiring fine deeds and simply
grasped him firmly around the middle and
bore him to the house.</p>

<p>He kicked all the way, merely to maintain
his self-respect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where shall I put &#8217;im?&rdquo; gasped the girl,
stumbling along the hall, the other four at
her heels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, here,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby, opening
the sitting-room door, and running across
the floor to close and lock the French windows.</p>

<p>Anna stood him down on his feet and gave
him one good, if unauthorized, shake for all
the kicks she had received.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she said, as a woman will.</p>


<p class="illus pgbrk"><a name="png.228" id="png.228"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

 </span>And it was precisely at this point the
&ldquo;language,&rdquo; feelingly alluded to before,
happened.</p>

<p>The boy glared round at his victors, now
all grouped at the door.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;You beasly girls,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<h3 class="chap">A LESSON IN DISCIPLINE</h3>


<p class="first"><span>That</span> is why &ldquo;Greenways&rdquo; should have
hidden its shamed head in one of the
mountain&#8217;s tender mists instead of gaily smiling
out at the world that morning.</p>

<p>When Miss Kinross rode briskly up the
drive, perhaps an hour later, she had no suspicion
that so truly shocking an occurrence
had befallen the sunny place.</p>

<p>She leaned her bicycle against a ficus-covered
post and crossed the verandah, a
little surprised at the silence, for she was
accustomed on her morning visits to being
run into by Max on the red tricycle and to
find little girls everywhere swinging, skipping,
hoop-bowling, or doll-carrying.</p>

<p>She crossed the verandah and rang the
bell; the door was closed&mdash;a most unusual
thing.</p>

<p>Anna appeared and seemed to hesitate about
asking her in.</p>

<p><a name="png.231" id="png.231"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">217</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Would you mind coming into the dining-room,
ma&#8217;am?&rdquo; she said at last; for how
might a sitting-room be used for its legitimate
purpose with a ramping rebel at large in
it?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Miss Kinross. &ldquo;Is Miss
Bibby in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye-e-es,&rdquo; said Anna, and opened the
dining-room door.</p>

<p>The little girls were all here. Miss Bibby
had said they might do exactly as they liked
this morning. Pauline sat crocheting at a
grey woollen shoulder cape which was destined
for some old woman in some old asylum,
and was among the least interesting of her
work. Lynn was reading. Not face downward,
on a rug and with swiftly-moving eyes
and hurrying breath, as was her custom with
a living book, but she had merely picked up
the <cite>History of England</cite> and sat with it quite
listlessly on a chair. And Muffie was standing
at the window, breathing on a pane from
time to time and then drearily drawing
figures upon her breath.</p>

<p>How could one be gay and do as one liked
with the sitting-room door shut and locked
on Little Knickerbockers?</p>

<p>Miss Bibby herself was standing before the
bookcase, turning over a volume here and
another one there. When Miss Kinross came
in she was at Herbert Spencer&#8217;s <cite>Education</cite>,
<a name="png.232" id="png.232"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">218</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>thinking that surely so wise and practical
an observer of youth as he must have offered
some recipe for such a situation as had
just passed.</p>

<p>But Spencer held out no helping hand.
The lines on her forehead deepened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you all well?&rdquo; said Miss Kinross,
coming forward to shake hands with her.
&ldquo;How do you do, little girls? How are the
coughs? And where is my little cavalier?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he&mdash;&rdquo; said Miss Bibby, hesitating
a second, then deciding not quite to conceal
the outrage since here might be wisdom.
Surely here <em>must</em> be wisdom; for could any
one dwell side by side with an author like
Hugh Kinross and not absorb it in every
pore?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Max has been,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby, &ldquo;not&mdash;not
quite good, I am sorry to say. He&mdash;I
have been obliged to leave him by himself
in the sitting-room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;poor little chap;
what has he done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Bibby looked helplessly from one little
girl to the other. She could not actually
repeat the terrible language, and yet she did
so badly need help in the emergency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;I regret to say he quite forgot himself
and used some naughty words,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;What would you do in my position,
Miss Kinross?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.233" id="png.233"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">219</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Kate with a comfortable smile,
&ldquo;I&#8217;d let him out. He&#8217;s such a little fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he hasn&#8217;t said he is sorry,&rdquo; said Miss
Bibby anxiously. &ldquo;I told him that when
he rang the sitting-room bell I would go at
once, for I should know it meant he was
sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And hasn&#8217;t he rung it, the young scamp?&rdquo;
said Kate, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, he did, several times,&rdquo; admitted
Miss Bibby unhappily; &ldquo;but when I opened
the door he said he had rung to say he wasn&#8217;t
sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kate laughed outright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a man he will make!&rdquo; she said
admiringly.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby looked as if she did not quite
follow the train of reasoning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I took the bell away,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;and told him I would come every half hour
and ask through the door if he was sorry.
The second half hour is nearly up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Kate impulsively, &ldquo;let&#8217;s go
and peep through the verandah window.
Half an hour is a frightful time, Miss Bibby;
he will have cried himself sick. Think what
a baby he is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They tiptoed round to the verandah, the
little girls at their heels, and they peeped
cautiously through the window.</p>

<p><a name="png.234" id="png.234"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">220</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Max was riding his tricycle. He had
arranged the furniture to suit himself&mdash;a little
table here, a chair there, and the rest of the
things pushed out of the way; and he was
earnestly practising some sharp turns and
curves, in and out, out and in of the articles
he had stood about. He had his tongue a
little way out, a sure sign of the undivided
attention he was giving the work. The way
he manipulated the handles, the command he
had over the little machine was really admirable.</p>

<p>Kate was convulsed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby, &ldquo;how did
he get his tricycle? It certainly was not
there when I went in last. Who gave him
his tricycle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, Miss Bibby,&rdquo; said Lynn meekly.
&ldquo;I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lynn!&rdquo; said Miss Bibby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he looked so lonely,&rdquo; said the little
girl piteously.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby went round at once to the other
door and demanded &ldquo;Trike,&rdquo; though Kate
strongly advised against it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve quite fin&#8217;shed with it,&rdquo; said the
rebel sweetly, and dismounted without a
struggle.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby wheeled it out, somewhat
ignominiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to sit down quietly and think
<a name="png.235" id="png.235"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">221</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>how very naughty you have been, Max,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Remember, I am coming in a
few minutes to ask you if you are sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A&#8217;right,&rdquo; said Max cheerfully.</p>

<p>The ladies went back to the dining-room
and conversation took a wider trend, for Miss
Bibby seemed not too certain now of the
judgment of the author&#8217;s sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I brought you round that book I promised,&rdquo;
said Miss Kinross, &ldquo;but I haven&#8217;t
found your story yet. I have hunted everywhere
again for it, and I <em>cannot</em> think where
Hugh could have put it. Are you sure you
are not in a hurry for it? I <em>could</em> write to
Hugh, of course, though I really don&#8217;t know
his address; he only told me Melbourne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby, &ldquo;I would not
have him worried on any account. A few
days will not make any difference. I can
wait until he returns. And it is possible&rdquo;&mdash;her
cheeks flushed, her eyes sparkled with the
hope&mdash;&ldquo;that he has taken the MS with him
and means to look through it while he is
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he did look through it,&rdquo; said Kate;
&ldquo;he told me he had spent all the morning
over it. That is what makes me doubtful
that he can have taken it. He said so distinctly
that it was on his desk and that I was
to take it across to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes held a troubled look. Hugh was
<a name="png.236" id="png.236"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">222</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>so hopelessly untidy with his papers that it
was just possible the precious MS had fallen
into the waste-paper basket and been reduced
to smoke by Lizzie. Still it seemed unwise
to meet trouble half-way. Hugh would be
back now any day, so there was no use to
worry the poor authoress unnecessarily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I must be off if I am to
get my ride. But I tell you I shall not enjoy
it a bit without the little man on the little
red tricycle pounding along behind me to
the corner as usual. You couldn&#8217;t find it
possible to let him out now? He <em>must</em> feel
good by this. You never feel naughty as
long as this, do you, Muffie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Muffie stoutly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys are so different,&rdquo; sighed Miss Bibby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let us have one more peep before I
go,&rdquo; pleaded Kate.</p>

<p>They tiptoed round to the verandah window
again. But this time there was no sign whatever
of the rebel though both doors were still
locked on the outside. Miss Bibby flew back
in terror to the door that opened into the hall;
she had taken the key of the verandah doorway.
But as her eyes went wildly searching
among the furniture they fell upon a dusty
little sandal with a brown little foot attached.
The boy had crawled so completely underneath
the low sofa that nothing more of him
was visible.</p>

<p><a name="png.237" id="png.237"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">223</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Max,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby.</p>

<p>Not a toe quivered.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby stooped down and laid a hand
on the foot; the muscles of it lay soft and
resistless beneath her fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Max,&rdquo; she said again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh,&rdquo; said Lynn, whose nature was
easily strung high, &ldquo;is he dead! Oh, is he
dead!&rdquo; She leapt across the room.</p>

<p>But Miss Bibby was gently drawing more
of the unresisting body into view&mdash;the scratched
and chubby knees that succeeded the brown
feet, and that were perfect little &ldquo;calendars
of distress,&rdquo; the three-inch &ldquo;trousers,&rdquo; the
crumpled tunic, the little smudgy face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fast asleep!&rdquo; she said tenderly, and
gathered him very softly up into her arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fast asleep!&rdquo; said Kate, and something
stirred at her heart and made her long to
gather up the chubby rogue herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will lay him down on the sofa,&rdquo; whispered
Miss Bibby, but made no haste to do so,
so sweet was the sense of the warm, helpless
child body in her arms.</p>

<p>But when the little girls had flown to make
a nest with cushions and proclaimed it ready,
what further excuse had she? She moved
gently across the floor with her burden. But
the motion broke the boy&#8217;s light sleep and he
stirred in her arms and opened half an eye.
It fell on Kate.</p>

<p><a name="png.238" id="png.238"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">224</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;I&#8217;m coming,&rdquo; he said sleepily, &ldquo;wait for
me,&rdquo; and sank away again&mdash;&ldquo;wait for me,&rdquo;
and struggled back almost to wakefulness.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby sat down on the sofa with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said soothingly; &ldquo;hush, go
to sleep, love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Love of course instantly opened his eyes
wide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m going wiv her,&rdquo; he said, looking
at Kate. &ldquo;I always go wiv her to the
corner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my little boy was naughty,&rdquo; murmured
Miss Bibby in his ear. &ldquo;Is he my own
little good boy again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Max nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get the licycle,&rdquo; he commanded the three
little sisters who were looking at him yearningly.</p>

<p>They flew to obey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m hungly,&rdquo; he announced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;you had no breakfast, darling&mdash;Pauline,
quickly, some arrowroot biscuits and
a glass of milk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anna herself brought in the little tray;
she had a soft spot in her heart for this member
of the black-hearted sex after all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I put cream on them for you, darling,&rdquo;
she said, and proffered the biscuits.</p>

<p>Max munched away. &ldquo;I like cleam,&rdquo; he
said, licking it lovingly off one biscuit.</p>

<p><a name="png.239" id="png.239"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">225</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Well, I am thankful the insurrection is
over and that discipline has been so firmly
maintained,&rdquo; said Kate with a twinkle in her
eye.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby blushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sorry, aren&#8217;t you, darling?&rdquo; she
said, feeling after her formula as a matter of
duty.</p>

<p>Max nodded again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say you are sorry, darling boy,&rdquo; she
whispered.</p>

<p>Max patted her cheek and then stole his
little arm round her neck in a perfectly
cherubic way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m solly,&rdquo; he said; then he seemed to
realize more clearly that the lady&#8217;s honour
had to be vindicated before all these &ldquo;girls,&rdquo;
and he repeated more loudly and without being
asked, &ldquo;I&#8217;m velly solly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You darling!&rdquo; cried the delighted Miss
Bibby, and clasped and kissed him again.</p>

<p>Pauline wheeled &ldquo;Trike&rdquo; out to the foot of
the steps, Lynn rushed for the ever lost boy-hat,
Muffie flew to pick a stone up from the
path before the little wheel.</p>

<p>Then a flash of irresistible humour shone
in Kate Kinross&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Max,&rdquo; she said with exceeding suddenness,
&ldquo;what are you sorry for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Max mounted his machine from behind
and settled himself in his saddle.</p>

<p class="pgbrk"><a name="png.240" id="png.240"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">226</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Solly cos I was shut up,&rdquo; he said in
the most perfect faith, and then pushed
at his little red pedals and started slowly
away.</p>

<h3 class="chap">IN PRINT AT LAST</h3>


<p class="first"><span>Pauline</span> and Muffie had gone flying
down to the gate to run behind the
bicycle and tricycle as far as the corner
where the little red tricycle had always to
turn and come back.</p>

<p>Lynn hung back a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care of this till I come back, will
you, Miss Bibby?&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&#8217;m keeping
it for Max.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>This</em> was a paper boat that Kate had cleverly
folded for Lynn while she waited, using a
sheet she tore haphazard from a periodical
that she had under her arm, part of the morning&#8217;s
post.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby took the boat, and when Lynn
had darted off after the other young ones,
she examined it with a view to finding out
how Kate made these clever little things that
the children so greatly delighted in.</p>

<p>And there leaped up at her eyes from the
printed sheet one of the cutting sentences she
had put into the mouth of the hero of her
<a name="png.242" id="png.242"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">228</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>story, the <cite>Hypocrites</cite>! Another and another
sentence followed&mdash;there stood out her own
heroine&#8217;s name in the heavenly black of type!
At last, at last. Oh, how good of him, how
very good&mdash;he had plainly taken the tale with
him, and got it into this <cite>Melbourne Review</cite>,
which was an infinitely better medium than
the <cite>Evening Mail</cite>! How very, very good of
him&mdash;this explained Kate&#8217;s inability to find
the MS!</p>

<p>Her eyes tore up and down the folded sail;&mdash;this
sentence was different&mdash;sharper, pithier,
better rounded than she had written it. A
soliloquy was missing there&mdash;and better so,
its inclusion would have been a mistake.
Oh, how good, how good he was! Her
quivering fingers fumbled with the folding&mdash;Lynn
and Max would forgive her for spoiling
their boat when they knew&mdash;when she showed
them her name in print.</p>

<p>Ah, how hungry were her eyes for the sight
of it, the sight of the simple name &ldquo;Agnes
Bibby&rdquo; at the head of her first signed story&mdash;the
story that was to take away the reproach
from the name that the ill-starred interview
had brought!</p>

<p>Then the heavens clapped down on her
head and the deadliest sickness assailed her.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">The heading of the columns said the
<cite>Hypocrites</cite>, and the line beneath &ldquo;By
Hugh Kinross.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="chap">A MASTER MIND</h3>


<p class="first"><span>Hugh</span> had come back. When he had gone
away he had taken with him one small
portmanteau that went easily into the luggage
rack above his head. But on the return
journey he had quite a little sum to pay for
excess luggage.</p>

<p>For instance no railway carries a motor
bicycle for the consideration tendered to it
for a passenger ticket. And a motor bicycle
was amongst the things turned out on the
Burunda platform when Hugh came back,
and, to the astonishment of Kate who had
gone to meet him, claimed by him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; she exclaimed when
assured it was unmistakably his, &ldquo;how
glad I am! I knew you would come to it
sooner or later. Oh, what rides we will have
together!&rdquo; Her face beamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Preserve us!&rdquo; said Hugh; &ldquo;Melbourne
is not responsible for developing maniacal
symptoms in me, I assure you. It&#8217;s for you,
of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.244" id="png.244"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">230</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;You mad boy,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;haven&#8217;t I
already the best you could buy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it turns your little face red,&rdquo; said
Hugh, &ldquo;and makes your little heart beat too
fast on these hills. This one won&#8217;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then it was that Kate discovered the
motor attachment of the new machine and
was divided between ecstasy and economic
qualms.</p>

<p>Hugh swiftly laid the latter. The speculation
had gone well&mdash;better than his best
expectations; he had to break out somewhere,
he said.</p>

<p>The breaking out included a tricycle for
Muffie, who was ever in hot water with Max
for stealing rides on &ldquo;Trike&rdquo; just when that
gentleman needed the steed himself. A
splendid set of croquet was for Pauline, who
delighted in the game and had been overwhelmed
with sorrow because one night, when
mallets and balls &ldquo;happened&rdquo; to be left
out on the lawn all night, a vagrant cow with
a depraved appetite came in and, as Paul said
mournfully, &ldquo;went and chewed corners all
over the balls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For Lynn, who had been heard bewailing
the fact that all the books she loved had
been left in the other house, was a large
parcel containing six of the most delightful
fairy-books in the world.</p>

<p>And, most exciting of all, there were four
<a name="png.245" id="png.245"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">231</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>volumes, thin certainly, but most gaily bound
and gilt-edged and padded up as well as
possible with thick paper and pictures&mdash;the
books they had all written that day in
the summer-house.</p>

<p>There they lay, three bound in scarlet
and one in green, <cite>The Horty Stepmother</cite>,
by Pauline Lomax; <cite>The Fairy who Had</cite>,
by Lynn Lomax; <cite>There was a Dog</cite>, by
Muffie Lomax; and <cite>The Mother who said
No</cite>, by Max Lomax. Kate was delighted
with them and said she would give much to
be at the elbow of the Judge and Mrs. Lomax
in New Zealand when these choice volumes
from their gifted offspring reached them.</p>

<p>For Miss Bibby too there was an offering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There aren&#8217;t many modern women left
who can fitly wear these things,&rdquo; Hugh said
when he showed it to Kate, &ldquo;but it struck
me that it would become a certain old-world
air that lingers about Agnes Bibby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, ho,&rdquo; said Kate to herself, and stole
a glance at him; but she allowed warmly
that the thing was very pretty.</p>

<p>It was a chatelaine made of finely-fretted
silver. The customary thimble, scissors and
other useful and feminine trifles dangled
there, but there was also added a delicately-chased
case that might have been expected
to hold a bodkin, but contained indeed a very
up-to-date fountain-pen, gold-mounted.</p>

<p><a name="png.246" id="png.246"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">232</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;A woman without a waistcoat pocket
for her fountain-pen has always seemed such
a pathetic object to me,&rdquo; Hugh said. &ldquo;When
you were a business woman, K, it often
moved me to internal tears to notice the
disadvantage you were at in this respect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kate acknowledged the disadvantage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though I did stick to a skirt pocket long
after the dressmakers had declared them
anathema,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but there was always
the danger of sitting on your pen or having
it leak a wide black mark in the back width
of your best frock. Even the sacred repository
behind the ear that will lodge a penny pen
refuses to accommodate a stout and slippery
fountain one. But with that arrangement
she will be able to make notes all day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hugh hastened to display a miniature note-book,
also made to hang suspended from the
waist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will be armed at all points, you see,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and the minute she sees men like
columns walking, as some one says, she can
jot them down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what are all the other things?&rdquo;
asked Kate, pointing to several still unaccounted-for
parcels and hampers standing
about the verandah just where the driver
had set them down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, by George, yes,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;You
<a name="png.247" id="png.247"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">233</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>must look after those things, K, or they
won&#8217;t keep. It&#8217;s to-morrow&#8217;s dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow&#8217;s fiddlestick!&rdquo; said Kate unbelievingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8217;Tis, I assure you,&rdquo; said Hugh; &ldquo;I&#8217;m
giving a grand picnic to-morrow at the Falls
to celebrate my safe return. Thought of it
in bed last night, telephoned the X.Y.Z.
Company to pack a bit of lunch that would
keep a day and to meet the train with it, and
there you are,&rdquo; he waved his hand at the
hampers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bit of lunch!&rdquo; said Kate sarcastically.
&ldquo;Are you sure there is enough there to take
the edge off our appetites?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t get anxious,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;there&#8217;s
a little more to follow in the morning&mdash;little
things that don&#8217;t keep well, you know. We
can easily pick them up at the station as
we pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little things like&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; said Kate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mustard,&rdquo; said Hugh&mdash;&ldquo;I remembered
how you dislike stale mustard. And
butter&mdash;you can&#8217;t leave butter shut up, you
know&mdash;and other little things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half a dozen of everything, I suppose,&rdquo;
Kate said, attacking the hampers. &ldquo;H&#8217;m,
champagne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&#8217;ve got to drink the health of
those shares.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poultry.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.248" id="png.248"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">234</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;It will keep, won&#8217;t it? They assured me
it was only cooked at 2 o&#8217;clock to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it will <em>keep</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peaches&mdash;pineapples&mdash;French confectionery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear girl, you will all want a
square feed when you get to the bottom of
those Falls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who are we all, pray?&rdquo; inquired
Kate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;there are the ducky
little girls, that&#8217;s two. I sent them a wire
each this morning and had their acceptances
before the X.Y.Z. got to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was smart,&rdquo; said Kate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I rather pride myself on my executive
abilities when I&#8217;ve once got going,&rdquo; said
Hugh. &ldquo;Next I wired Edith and told her
to stay away and Gowan, too. Told her
you&#8217;d chaperone. I don&#8217;t want the gloomy
brewer&#8217;s soul going by me like a stork at my
own picnic. Told her to send along the
kids though&mdash;all five of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s seven,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;and ourselves,
nine,&mdash;anyone else? I hope so, for
there&#8217;s enough here for nineteen, and I hate
waste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I sent wires over the road, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half a dozen wires?&rdquo; said Kate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Hugh innocently, &ldquo;there
are only five of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.249" id="png.249"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">235</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Five separate wires,&mdash;Hugh Kinross, you
want a keeper!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;I <em>was</em> only going to
send one to Miss Bibby, but then it struck
me how pleased a kid would be to get a
telegram. I know I never did or I&#8217;d have
burst with pride in my promising youth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twelve wires at&mdash;at? How many words,
sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;they wouldn&#8217;t have
cost so much only I took a fancy to drop into
poetry with them. And in spite of precedents
the operator declined to do it as a
friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a minute,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;half of
those wires are doomed to be wasted. Your
executive ability is a thing to marvel at, I
grant you, but you overlooked the little fact
that Lomax-<i>cum</i>-Whooping-Cough may not
foregather round a tablecloth with Gowan-<i>plus</i>-Perfect-Health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hugh certainly looked nonplussed at this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a moral impossibility for one
of the parties unaided by the other to eat all
this,&rdquo; pursued Kate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good woman,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;go and
put the perishables in the ice-chest. My
master mind will soon deal with the difficulty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Kate moved backwards and forwards
between the kitchen and the verandah and
<a name="png.250" id="png.250"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">236</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Hugh tilted his chair and took out a cigar to
help meet the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Kate when only a heap of
fine ash remained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite well,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;Both parties
shall attend and not the ghost of a whoop
shall be exchanged. I ordered two large
sociables,&mdash;the drivers will have instructions
not to approach nearer than thirty feet
within each other. A whoop microbe would
hardly travel thirty feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;as far as that is concerned
I don&#8217;t see that Edith need have any
anxiety. She might pass a wagonette with
scarlet fever convalescents herself any day.
But what about the actual picnic? Muffie
defines this word as eating nice things down
a gully. Could we comfortably pass sandwiches
to each other there at a distance of
thirty feet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knowing what a fidget Edith is I propose
to make the distance several hundred
feet,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;See here, it is plain I&#8217;ve
got to have two picnics now to-morrow. At
the head of the Falls I disembark my first
contingent,&mdash;say the <ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original has double quotes">&lsquo;Greenways&rsquo;</ins> one. I
give them instructions to go straight down
to the bottom of the second Fall,&mdash;they are
all good climbers. When they&#8217;ve got a
good start,&mdash;say twenty minutes, I call up
the second contingent, the little pets and
<a name="png.251" id="png.251"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">237</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Edith&#8217;s youngsters and start them down.
You will go with these as chaperone and camp
at the foot of the first Fall. We must explain
to Miss Bibby that your wing extends over
both Falls and that she as well as the little
pets are brooded beneath it. I&#8217;ve already
bespoken two caddies from the links to
carry the hampers, and they will have
plenty of exercise going up and down the
steps. As host I shall endeavour to divide
myself equally between my two divisions of
guests. And probably the exercise between
the two tables will rid me of any superfluous
flesh I may have about me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; laughed Kate, &ldquo;it is one way
out of the difficulty. I certainly should
not have thought of anything myself but of
postponing one party until another day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hugh complacently, &ldquo;it takes
the strategy of a general or a genius to fix up
little things like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Four breathless figures came dashing over
the road and through the &ldquo;Tenby&rdquo; gate
round to the side verandah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh,&rdquo; said Lynn imploringly, &ldquo;you
have finished your tea, haven&#8217;t you? Miss
Bibby wouldn&#8217;t let us &#8217;sturb you before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We counted up to a thousand to give
you time,&rdquo; said Pauline, &ldquo;and <em>we</em> could eat
enough tea in a hundred and fifty&mdash;unless
there were drop cakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.252" id="png.252"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">238</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;We&#8217;ve got to go to bed in ten minutes,&rdquo;
said Muffie tragically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;re coming,&rdquo; shouted Max, and he
flourished the rhymed blue telegram that
he had carried about all day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you get our answers?&rdquo; cried Lynn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We paid for them ourselves,&rdquo; said Pauline.
&ldquo;Miss Bibby just wanted to send one answer
and say &lsquo;All accept with pleasure&rsquo;! But we
just <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em>, and we all went to the post and
we told the woman just what to put, and it
would have been a lot better only we didn&#8217;t
have much time to think, only while we walked
up the hill, and Lynn did the most, &#8217;cause
she can always think of the rhymingest words,
and we&#8217;d have made them much longer only
we could only afford ninepence each, and
we had to lend Max threepence, &#8217;cause he&#8217;d
only got sixpence left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped for sheer lack of breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ninepence each!&rdquo; cried Kate, &ldquo;and
you once thought of writing some articles on
teaching Thrift to young Australia, Hugh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that was before I was really acquainted
with young Australia,&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you like them?&rdquo; asked Lynn anxiously,
&ldquo;I was &#8217;fraid you wouldn&#8217;t like grin,
but nothing else would rhyme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like them!&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;I shall keep
them in my desk among my Correspondence
from Celebrated Persons. As a special and
<a name="png.253" id="png.253"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">239</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>particular favour I will allow Kate to see
them,&rdquo; and he drew out the budget of telegraph
forms.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div>&ldquo;Your friend Pauline</div>
<div>Will be glad to be seen,&rdquo;</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">was the uniquely <i>apropos</i> answer to his invitation
to the eldest daughter of the Judge.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div>&ldquo;Max will come quick</div>
<div>To your nice picnic&rdquo;</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">was effort number two. There had been a
variant reading of this&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div>&ldquo;Max a plate will lick</div>
<div>At your nice picnic,&rdquo;</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the matter had been fought out before
entering the post office, Lynn liking the
first and Pauline and Max himself inclining
to the second. But Miss Bibby being made
umpire declared against the second as not
very &ldquo;nice.&rdquo; So Hugh knew only the fact
that Max would come quick.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div>&ldquo;Please take enough</div>
<div>To the picnic. From Muff&rdquo;</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">would assuredly not have been allowed by
Miss Bibby one little month since, to be sent
as an acceptance to the invitation of a person
nearly eight times her own age. The fact
<a name="png.254" id="png.254"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">240</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>that it was handed across the counter&mdash;and
with a smile, too&mdash;was a sign that the foundations
of a liberal education may be successfully
laid even at thirty-six.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div>&ldquo;Your loving friend Lynn</div>
<div>With much joy doth grin,&rdquo;</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">in no way satisfied Lynn&#8217;s ideas either of
composition or beauty, but she had been so
occupied helping with the couplets of the
others that she was forced to compose hers
standing on the door step of the post office.
The word &ldquo;grin&rdquo; vexed her; yet &ldquo;thin&rdquo;
would not allow itself to be worked in and
no other &ldquo;ryum&rdquo; that would make sense
would suggest itself, so she quite mournfully
sent on the information that with joy she
did grin.</p>

<p>Pauline pounced on the formal telegram
from Miss Bibby&mdash;&ldquo;Will bring my charges.
Many thanks for thinking of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did a <em>much</em> better one for her,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;only she wouldn&#8217;t send it. I liked it
best of all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; asked Hugh, and learnt
that the &ldquo;rejected address&rdquo; was&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div>&ldquo;Won&#8217;t it be nibby?</div>
<div>Yours truly, Miss Bibby.&rdquo;</div>
</div>

<p>But at this point Miss Bibby&#8217;s slender
figure in its pale grey muslin was seen crossing
<a name="png.255" id="png.255"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">241</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the road, so the presents were hastily distributed,
and four pairs of young eyes tried
to outrival in brightness the just peeping
stars of the early evening.</p>

<p>Miss Bibby shook hands with Kate, then
with Hugh, on whom she bent a curious glance:
she had half expected to see him turn aside
and dive through the doorway at the sight
of herself, yet there he stood as calm and
unashamed as possible.</p>

<p>He took her hand and held it in a pleasant
grasp. He looked down at her in the half-fatherly,
bantering fashion he adopted to the
&ldquo;ducky little girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and how is the poor
little pen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Bibby shot one keen glance at him.</p>

<p>He decided that she did not like the slighting
reference to that pen and strove to rectify
his mistake. &ldquo;You know, however good an
instrument it is, I don&#8217;t like to see it in a
woman&#8217;s hand,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;it&#8217;s an edged
weapon and cuts into even the hard hand
that holds it; your little hand would bleed
if you grasped it perpetually. I better like
to think of it smoothing these little heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked&mdash;he knew not why himself&mdash;half
sadly at the eager children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&#8217;t he an anachronism?&rdquo; laughed
Kate, &ldquo;I often tell him the reason he has not
married is he has never been able to find
<a name="png.256" id="png.256"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">242</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>any one sufficiently Early Victorian for him.
Imagine preaching a doctrine of &lsquo;Thou
shalt not write&rsquo; to women to-day! Every
woman her own authoress is the accepted
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah well,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;I know a better
thing.&rdquo; But though Kate pressed him he
might not tell to these two spinsters that
&ldquo;Every woman a mother&rdquo; was in his thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will say good-night,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby,
&ldquo;come children&mdash;at once, if you please.&rdquo; She
shook hands with Kate and this time only
bowed to Hugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you give her her present?&rdquo; asked
Kate when the gate closed and the grey
figure and the little running ones were merged
in the grey of the tender dusk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;I&#8217;ll have to find a
better chance; I evidently put my foot in
it, didn&#8217;t I?&rdquo; He pondered over the keen
eye-glance that had met his once or twice.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;I tell you what it is, Kate,&rdquo; he said,
when, his cigar finished, they went into the
house, &ldquo;that girl will never really forgive me
for the interview, however much she may
think she does.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first"><span>The</span> morning rose in mist; the sun moved
upwards and still the mist lingered, as
if anxious to drape and hide the rough edges
of this oddly-arranged picnic.</p>

<p>Sometimes the wagonette in front was lost
to sight by a rolling curtain of gauze; sometimes
a wind swept the road clear and then
the children waved hats and kissed hands to
each other.</p>

<p>Dora and Beatrice were visions of beauty
and fashion in smartly-cut linen gowns and
the latest thing in stocks and belts and
shoes and hats and gloves and parasols; not
over-dressed in the least, but so correct, so
up-to-date, so &ldquo;well-planned,&rdquo; Miss Bibby
involuntarily drew a heavy sigh as she looked
at them.</p>

<p>In their turn the two young girls pleasantly
patronized Miss Bibby. It was the first time
they had seen her, though they had heard of
her often, and indeed were a little anxious to
meet her, for Mrs. Gowan had teased Hugh
<a name="png.258" id="png.258"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">244</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>before them, ever since the interview, about
the &ldquo;fair and mysterious Miss Bibby.&rdquo; But
this figure in its plain blue serge and its out-of-date,
if spotless, cuffs and collar! This
gentle, tired face with faint lines at the eye
corners and its brown hair simply waved
back from the forehead instead of bulging
out on a frame as Fashion insisted!</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need not have been afraid,&rdquo; they
whispered to each other.</p>

<p>Effie and Florence, second and third in age
of the five little Gowans and mustering some
fifteen years between them, sat up on the
box next the driver and whispered together.
All the way they hardly moved their eyes from
the wagonette in front, where the faces of
their loved little friends appeared and disappeared
like flowers of the vapour.</p>

<p>The driver was an unemotional man, long
used to being squeezed up on his seat by more
people than that seat was ever built to accommodate;
used, too, to having his ears
filled with every sort and condition of conversation.
City men talked to each other beside
him of stocks and shares; tourists compared
the views along the roads with New Zealand
views, and American ones and German and
Swiss: mothers babbled of their babies and
their servants; girls whispered to girls of
&ldquo;Jack&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jim&rdquo;&mdash;lovers&mdash;and these
allowed him more seat space&mdash;of love.</p>

<p><a name="png.259" id="png.259"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">245</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Why should he lend a more than quarter ear
as usual to the chatter of two little bits of
girls? How should he know the demure
holland frocks beside him covered revolutionists?</p>

<p>Hugh started off his first party, Paul and
Lynn, Muffie and Max and Miss Bibby.</p>

<p>The children besought him to come, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be just a common picnic, if you
don&#8217;t,&rdquo; Pauline said, looking disparagingly
round her family party.</p>

<p>Hugh promised to divide his time equally
between his two sets of guests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the boys bring your basket down with
the other things, Miss Bibby,&rdquo; he said, seeking
to relieve her of a tiny basket she carried,
&ldquo;then you will have your hands free when you
come to the ladder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, it is very light, I can manage
it quite well,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby, holding fast
to the handle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s her lunch,&rdquo; volunteered the ever
ready Muffie, &ldquo;she doesn&#8217;t eat things like
you&#8217;ve got. But we do,&mdash;and we&#8217;re getting
hungry now, aren&#8217;t we, Paul?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;Can we begin to
set the tables as soon as we get down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hugh looked disappointedly at the miserable
little basket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&#8217;t you even make a feast and be
merry to-day?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p><a name="png.260" id="png.260"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">246</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Miss Bibby glanced away from the kindly
eyes. How could they look so clear and merry
when he had stolen the work of her brain?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said coldly, &ldquo;I prefer
my own things.&rdquo; And when he turned away
instantly, quite hurt at the unfriendly tone,
she caught hold of Max&#8217;s hand and began
the steep descent with a mist, not entirely of
the mountains, blinding her eyes. For she
was heartsick this morning, and it was not
only the loss of the story that had occasioned
the wretchedness, but her faith and admiration
for this man had been torn away so
roughly that certain sensations she hardly
realized seemed numbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along, dear, hold my hand,&rdquo; she
said to Max,&mdash;&ldquo;Lynn, Muffie,&mdash;walk carefully!
Hold to the rail at the steep places,
Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she always said this as a matter of duty,
and equally as a matter of duty they never
heeded her, for even Max knew every step of
the way and had manfully climbed the ladders
alone, and crept sure-footed over the great
fallen trees that formed bridges, since he was
three.</p>

<p>Down, down they went through the exquisite
gorge; greener and still more green
grew the way as the path wound farther and
farther away from the sunburnt lands overhead.
Giant tree ferns grouped themselves
<a name="png.261" id="png.261"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">247</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>together in one place and in another guarded
the path in sentinel-like rows. You looked up
and sheer walls of rock towered thousands of
feet above your head&mdash;brown, naked, rugged
walls here&mdash;and there, where the waterfalls
dripped, clothed in a marvellous mantle of
young ferns. Here a huge, jagged promontory
stretched across your way, and the
diplomatic path, unable to force a way through,
simply ceased in its downward bent, and with
handrails and steps led you up again.</p>

<p>As a reward for expended breath, a rail at
the top encircled a stone peninsula and gave
you a resting-place and an outlook&mdash;an outlook
startlingly beautiful by reason of its
unexpectedness. For the promontory had
hidden the valley&#8217;s loveliness, and here you
found a sudden glorious peep at it. And
then your eyes looking down, down below the
rail, saw that cascades had met and the water
was plunging in a wide glistening sheet down
the dizzy height.</p>

<p>The path led downwards again; the heart of
the traveller has seen the falling of the water
and cannot have its desire until it stands
somewhere where the same down-dropping
stream forms a deep pool and ceases.</p>

<p>Down, down they went, Miss Bibby, Muffie
and Max leading and, far behind, Pauline and
Lynn, lingering as was their wont (they had
a passion for pretending they were wandering
<a name="png.262" id="png.262"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">248</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>quite alone in the gully)&mdash;but occasionally
sending downwards a cooee to assure Miss
Bibby of their safety.</p>

<p>They were dangling their legs on a seat in
&ldquo;The Lovers&#8217; Cave,&rdquo; two little figures in
blue zephyr, when Paul gave a sudden exclamation
of dismay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick, quick,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we&#8217;re going too
slowly. Here come the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She seized Lynn&#8217;s hand and the two began
to hurry along the path again, for at a bend
just above them were the holland frocks and
mushroom hats of Florence and Effie.</p>

<p>Down, down, a hundred steps here, round
a bend there, down a damp ladder, hard as
they could go, and yet the holland frocks
gained on the blue every moment. Lynn
was panting, Pauline&#8217;s face streamed with
perspiration, and still they sought to increase
the distance; they could not have run more
conscientiously from their little friends if
they had been lepers.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">But on, on, resistlessly came the holland
frocks. Driven to bay Paul wheeled round&mdash;&ldquo;We
can&#8217;t go any faster,&rdquo; she shouted
desperately, &ldquo;you&#8217;ll just have to sit down and
wait.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="illus pgbrk"><a name="png.263" id="png.263"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">248a</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span><img src="images/illus-263.jpg"
 width="400" height="639" alt="" title="" /><br
 />&ldquo;Driven to bay Paul wheeled round.&rdquo;</p>


<p>On, on came Florence and Effie while Lynn
who had pulled up, too, regarded them in
horror. When they were within a distance of
ten feet she caught at Pauline&#8217;s hand and
<a name="png.265" id="png.265"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">249</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>began to run again. But the newcomers who
had dropped into a comfortable walk began
to run even faster.</p>

<p>Paul and Lynn dodged into &ldquo;Lurline&#8217;s
Bower&rdquo; that came along opportunely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;ll wait here while you go past as you&#8217;re
in such a hurry,&rdquo; Paul shouted.</p>

<p>But the holland frocks came on steadily,
steadily till they stood in the opening of the
bower, till they crushed themselves on the
very seat with the amazed blue ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ll catch our whooping,&rdquo; began
Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to,&rdquo; said Effie and Florence
succinctly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; said Paul and Lynn agitatedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s all right,&rdquo; said Florence, &ldquo;we &#8217;cided
all about it coming along, didn&#8217;t we, Eff?
It&#8217;s we&#8217;s who haves to cough, not mother, an&#8217;
we don&#8217;t mind, do we, Eff?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; said Effie stoutly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Paul, looking at the opening
of the bower as if she would dash out, &ldquo;we
promised your mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Effie and Florence cut off any possible
escape by jumping up and standing with
their backs to the opening. &ldquo;It&#8217;s too late,
we&#8217;ve caught it by now,&mdash;haven&#8217;t we, Eff?&rdquo;
said Florence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we have,&rdquo; said Effie, &ldquo;we&#8217;ve
<a name="png.266" id="png.266"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">250</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>got it as much as you have now. Oh we are
glad. Aren&#8217;t we, Florence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; said Florence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&#8217;t your Aunt Kate be coming after
you?&rdquo; asked Paul, looking fearfully along
the side of the gorge for the sight of a stout
figure of vengeance crushing downwards to
separate them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She thinks we&#8217;re only a little way in
front,&rdquo; chuckled the naughty children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who&#8217;s taking care of you?&rdquo; persisted
Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Dora and Miss Bee said they
would, but they always let us do anything,&rdquo;
said Effie easily, &ldquo;it was such a lovely chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think you are big sillies,&rdquo; said
Pauline virtuously, but she began untwisting
Effie&#8217;s tight brown curls and twisting them
together again in the way she had ever loved
to do.</p>

<p>While as to Lynn and Florence, they were
almost rubbing noses in the joy of the reunion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s just <em>too</em> dreadful at the hotel,&rdquo; said
Effie, &ldquo;we&#8217;d rather be at school. There&#8217;s
nothing to do all day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8217;Cept walk along the road with nurse,
and mind you don&#8217;t get your good school
frock spoiled&rdquo;&mdash;Effie&#8217;s was the complaint.
&ldquo;Can&#8217;t have fun in the hotel garden or you
spoil their silly old beds.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.267" id="png.267"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">251</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Can&#8217;t shout in the house or a lot of old
ladies put their fingers up at you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&#8217;t make a mud pie like at your house,
&#8217;cause you&#8217;ve got to be clean all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The angry duet went on and on till the
spirits of the little holland frocks were somewhat
relieved, after the restrictions imposed
upon them by the residence of their parents
for a &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; in a fashionable hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We just long and long for &lsquo;Greenways&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We talk in bed about the fun we used to
have in the orchard till we nearly cry. Don&#8217;t
we, Eff?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; said Effie, mournfully, &ldquo;but
now we&#8217;ll be able to come, &#8217;cause we&#8217;ll all have
whooping cough, too. Frank and Ted and
Nellie all say they&#8217;d rather have it than stop
away from &lsquo;Greenways&rsquo; any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Up through the ferns came the thin note of
Miss Bibby&#8217;s cooee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coo-ee-ee,&rdquo; shouted Pauline instantly in
return. Then looked a little troubled, for
cooee was to be interpreted that all was well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At all events it&#8217;s not our fault,&rdquo; she said
resignedly.</p>

<p>A stout figure of vengeance was indeed
coming along the path in the shape of Uncle
Hugh.</p>

<p>Tiny Nellie Gowan who could never keep a
secret ten minutes had suddenly revealed the
horrifying fact that &ldquo;Effie and Florence were
<a name="png.268" id="png.268"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">252</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>going to run and run till they catched the
whooping cough and all could go to Muffie&#8217;s
house again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Hugh had followed in their wake
promptly enough, but then he was stout,
while they were slim, and the race was consequently
not to him.</p>

<p>He drove Paul and Lynn downwards with
threats of dry bread and spring water for lunch.
And he bore his nieces, who cheerfully exculpated
their friends from blame, back to the
tables at the foot of the first Fall, where Kate
and the others were beginning to spread the
lunch.</p>

<p>And here nothing in the shape of wrath and
reproaches and argument could shake them
from the position behind which they had
entrenched themselves, namely that since the
coughing would have to be done by themselves
it mattered nothing to anybody if the affliction
came upon them.</p>

<p>Kate unpacked the baskets with a melancholy
air. It was useless, of course, to preserve
an appearance of anger towards the offenders,
but a bad quarter of an hour was undoubtedly
in store for her with their mother.</p>

<p>Hugh was optimistic. He declared that the
whooping cough microbe meeting the fresh
air microbe on such a fighting ground as a
mountain gully would be &ldquo;laid out in one
act.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.269" id="png.269"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">253</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>He stretched himself along a seat and indulged
in a smoke after his exertions, while
Kate and Florence and Effie made all ready
for lunch.</p>

<p>Dora and Beatrice had gone to sit in the
&ldquo;Lovers&#8217; Nook&rdquo; and try to feel romantic.
Kate had rejected their offers of assistance
in her work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you send away my little girls?&rdquo;
said Hugh lazily,&mdash;&ldquo;I don&#8217;t mean bad little
girls like those,&rdquo; he looked at the shamelessly
cheerful Florence and Effie, who were gathering
ferns for the tables, &ldquo;but my good little
girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silly little things,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;they get
on my nerves frightfully. I wanted to keep
my faculties clear for my work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Hugh, looking at his pipe,
&ldquo;they strike you that way, do they, K?
They seem rather charming to me to-day.
Perhaps apart&mdash;one cannot have both unfortunately&mdash;perhaps
one at a time, K, they
might seem to have more&mdash;er sense, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His hat was over his eyes, Kate could only
see his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my little me,&rdquo; said the woman&#8217;s heart,
&ldquo;the boy is serious!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She cut up a lettuce before she could trust
herself to speak and even ate a few shreds in
her agitation.</p>

<p>When she did speak her tone was motherly.</p>

<p><a name="png.270" id="png.270"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">254</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Hughie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;they are charming
little girls,&mdash;for a summer day on the mountain.
But we&#8217;re in our autumn now, you and
I, and for daily companionship I assure you
you would get more satisfaction from Lynn or
Muffie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hat was pushed an inch or two lower
still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;K&mdash;you&#8217;re a good sort, of course, but&mdash;I
get lonely sometimes, girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, boy. God knows it&#8217;s natural.
But&mdash;not a pretty butterfly, Hugh. A woman
nearer your own age, dear boy, some one to
be a restful companion for you, able to appreciate
your work, and fit in with your angles
instead of your having to attempt to unmake
yourself at your age and fit into hers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, don&#8217;t disturb me, I&#8217;m going to
sleep,&rdquo; said Hugh sulkily. What was the
use of asking a woman&#8217;s advice on any subject
under the sun?</p>

<p>The escaped caddies brought down more
hampers. In the strap of one of them were the
morning letters, forgotten till now.</p>

<p>Hugh opened them irritably, while Kate
meekly went on with her task of making a
salad.</p>

<p>She was engaged in the critical operation of
squeezing the juice from her sliced cucumber,
by pressing the top plate heavily down on the
bottom one, when the author gave so sudden
<a name="png.271" id="png.271"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">255</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and strong an exclamation that she dropped
the whole concern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What Tommy rot is this?&rdquo; he demanded
of her angrily. &ldquo;What lunatic trick have you
played me now, Kate? Where&#8217;s the last
number of the <cite>Melbourne Review</cite>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took the letter from his hand and read
it. It was from the editor of the <cite>Review</cite>, a
one time &ldquo;chief&rdquo; of Hugh&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I enclose you cheque for ten guineas as
arranged,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;and, of course, now you&#8217;re
a celebrity, old man, I&#8217;ve had to print it and
be thankful. But you wouldn&#8217;t have had the
cheek to send me a rotter of a story like that
six years ago, and you know it. You want
a change, that&#8217;s what it is, old man, you&#8217;re
attempting too much. Take a run over to
New Zealand, or go home. And if you&#8217;ve
been turning out any more stories like this
choice <cite>Hypocrites</cite>, take my advice and
burn &#8217;em before you blast your brand-new
reputation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&#8217;s the last <cite>Melbourne Review</cite>, I
ask you?&rdquo; roared Hugh. As if it were part
of Kate&#8217;s duty to bring files of the latest
magazines with her to picnics!</p>

<p>She delved instantly into her memory to
try to help him; another woman might have
chosen the moment to sulk, offended at his
tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It came on Thursday,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
<a name="png.272" id="png.272"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">256</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>remember tearing a page out to make a boat for
Muffie&mdash;I meant to have torn an advertisement
page, but found later it had part of a
story of yours on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the tale called?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<cite>The Hypocrites.</cite>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And my signature to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great heavens, girl, don&#8217;t you see what
your carelessness has done? You&#8217;ve sent
that confounded woman&#8217;s tale to the editor
as my work!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kate was forced gently to remind him that
he had enclosed the MS himself in an envelope
and addressed it to a typist with instructions
to forward to the <cite>Review</cite>.</p>

<p>Hugh sat down chapfallen. &ldquo;What a fool
I am!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;The tale was unspeakable.
It is enough to ruin any reputation.
And Wilkie&#8217;s not the man to retract either;
he&#8217;ll tell me the mistake&#8217;s my own and I&#8217;ll
have to grin and bear the ignominy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that poor girl,&rdquo; said Kate&mdash;&ldquo;her
story lost to her! No wonder I couldn&#8217;t
find her MS. I meant to have made you
hunt for it to-day, but this picnic put it out
of my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now Hugh gave a sudden roar of laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By George, K,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&#8217;t you see
the shrieking humour of the situation? The
<a name="png.273" id="png.273"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">257</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>woman thinks I&#8217;ve boned her precious story.
That&#8217;s why she has been treating me with
such cold dignity. Oh, hold me up, hold me
up, I feel ill!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But soon his hilarity sobered. The situation
also had a pathetic side. He remembered
the quiet shining of the authoress&#8217;s eyes
when she gave him the unfortunate roll of
MS. What must she be thinking of him?</p>

<p>&ldquo;K,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&#8217;m going down at once to
explain to Miss Bibby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what will Dora and Beatrice say?&rdquo;
said Kate doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hang Dora and Beatrice,&rdquo; said their
gallant host, &ldquo;you&#8217;ll have to make an excuse
for me. Besides, Agnes Bibby is as much my
guest as they are. I&#8217;ll eat my chicken down
there and my strawberries up here. You&#8217;ve
sent everything down for them, haven&#8217;t you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; said K.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Champagne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no&mdash;Miss Bibby does not touch such
things, I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me a bottle of champagne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kate handed him one and he tucked it
under his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive my spleen, old girl,&rdquo; he said, his
hand held out. &ldquo;I fear there&#8217;s a good deal
of the unvarnished brute in me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you want a tamer, my boy,&rdquo; said
Kate, squeezing his hand.</p>

<p><a name="png.274" id="png.274"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">258</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;I&#8217;ll go and make my
expiation. Again. I seem to be always doing
it. I tell you what it is, K, if I injure that
girl again I&#8217;ll have to marry her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went swinging off at a comfortable jog-trot
down the path, his bottle sticking out
from beneath one arm.</p>

<p>A look of thoughtful surprise dawned in
Kate&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;And upon my soul you might do <ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original lacks closing quote">worse,&rdquo;</ins>
she said&mdash;&ldquo;you might do worse.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="chap">AT THE SECOND FALL</h3>


<p class="first"><span>Miss Bibby</span> had prepared a delightful
meal for her charges from the generous
hamper the caddies carried down to her. Slices
of chicken lay in nests of finely shredded lettuce
with a delicate cream dressing lightly poured
on top. A mountain of ruddy strawberries
formed a centrepiece,&mdash;delicious and novel
cakes made side dishes, jellies quivered and
reflected on their sides the foaming waterfall.
While here, there and everywhere were
scattered evidences of the high skill chocolate
manufacturers are attaining to&mdash;hatchets,
saws, garden rakes, dolls&#8217; tea-sets, animals
of every description&mdash;all in the most delightful
kind of chocolate.</p>

<p>The children buzzed round the tables like
eager flies, but Miss Bibby would not have
them begin until their host had paid the visit
he had promised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I may as well get mine over,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;and then I can help all of you. And
<a name="png.276" id="png.276"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">260</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>it would be too depressing for you, wouldn&#8217;t
it, Paul, to see me eating what you think
my poor meal while you revel in all these
delicacies?&rdquo; She got out her tiny basket and
hastily emptied the contents of one of the
packets on to a plate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, darling Miss Bibby,&rdquo; implored
Lynn, clinging suddenly to her, &ldquo;do eat
something nice, just to-day. Oh do, do throw
your horrid basket away, and eat really truly
food for once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&#8217;t, darling&mdash;I really can&#8217;t,&rdquo; said Miss
Bibby, quite distressed at having to refuse such
a lovingly-put plea; &ldquo;some other day,&mdash;next
time you have a picnic. But not to-day.&rdquo;
She almost said &ldquo;Not <em>his</em> food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here he comes, here he comes,&rdquo; shrieked
the children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I begin&mdash;can I have a lawberry?&rdquo;
cried Max, fairly dancing in his impatience.</p>

<p>Hugh came down wiping his hot face with
his handkerchief. He took in the scene at a
glance,&mdash;the eager children, waiting for him
before they began, Miss Bibby seated at the
adjacent slab table where she had piled the
empty hampers, hastily eating a poor meal
from a plate before her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fall to, chickens,&rdquo; said Hugh, and the
four children made a glad, mad dash for their
seats and with glowing eyes &ldquo;fell to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hugh went to the grey slab table.</p>

<p><a name="png.277" id="png.277"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">261</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;My dear Miss Bibby, am I always to be
doing you an injury?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>And at that instant there rolled away from
Agnes Bibby&#8217;s soul all the heaviness that had
oppressed it, and the sun shone out.</p>

<p>Of course, of course there was some mistake,&mdash;he
had never meant to take credit for her
work!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;it was a mistake, of
course. You&mdash;you sent them the wrong
MS, that is all.&rdquo; Why had no lightning flash
of this possibility come to her before in her
darkness?</p>

<p>Hugh looked at her in speechless admiration.</p>

<p>Then he spoke, and slowly. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;you are without exception the most
sensible woman I have ever met.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now there ran into Agnes Bibby&#8217;s face
a flood of colour, quite as delicate and beautiful
as that which sometimes stained the fresh
young skins of Dora and Beatrice. She felt
so guilty&mdash;she had thought&mdash;what had she
not thought? She began to try to tell him
she was not as sensible as he imagined, but
he was so busy explaining to her how it all
happened, and pressing the ten-guinea cheque
upon her which he insisted her story had
earned, that she simply was afforded no
chance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said, pushing back the cheque
<a name="png.278" id="png.278"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">262</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>gently&mdash;&ldquo;I can only accept four guineas of
this&mdash;that is the most my story would have
earned. The rest your name commanded!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, nonsense,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that
<cite>Review</cite> always pays well, this is your own
cheque, fairly earned; remember I have
deprived you of all the glory of the story.
For I know Wilkie too well to be able to hope
that he will condescend to explain such a
mistake in his columns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Miss Bibby, dazzled, tucked the bit of
pink paper away in her little basket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;will you just
see if the children have enough to eat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear,&rdquo; said Miss Bibby,
fluttering up, &ldquo;I really had forgotten them
for the moment. I&mdash;I hope they have not
made themselves ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she had obtained doubtful satisfaction
on this point and turned her head again towards
Hugh, she found him in the act of tossing all
her packets of eatables one after the other
over the edge of the rock where the water
went plunging down to yet another fall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! hurrah!&rdquo; shouted Lynn, who
had seen the act, &ldquo;now she&#8217;ll have to eat
some of our lovely things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have a lawberry, Miss Bibby, go on,&rdquo;
Max enjoined, his little mouth full of the
delicious fruits and red juice dripping down
his tunic.</p>

<p><a name="png.279" id="png.279"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">263</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; began Miss Bibby.</p>

<p>But Hugh calmly tucked her hand in his
arm and led her to the children&#8217;s table. &ldquo;I
am taking you into dinner, madam, and I
insist that you eat everything I put before
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she did&mdash;or almost. Hugh let the
children revel as they liked in the good things,
and assured their anxious guardian that he
had chosen the lunch expressly from the point
of view of suitability for the delicate digestions
of children. And he laid down the maxim that
appetite was the safest guide in the world, and
when it said &ldquo;More&rdquo; no one but a Bumble
would say it nay.</p>

<p>He ate excellently himself; he uncorked
the champagne, and insisted upon her joining
him with it; the sparkling stuff filled all her
veins with fire. She ate chicken and found
that it was good&mdash;and very good. She ate
of other delicacies with which he plied her
plates and found all her system rejoiced. In
very truth she had lately pushed her diet
theory so far that she was in a state of semi-starvation.
She laughed, she chatted gaily,
she made as entertaining a companion for
that little lunch at the foot of the Fall as a
man need wish to have. Hugh stared at
her in amaze once or twice; it was as if
a white tightly-closed rosebud had suddenly
blossomed into beautiful bloom.</p>

<p><a name="png.280" id="png.280"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">264</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Happiness,&rdquo; said Hugh to himself, &ldquo;that is
all she needs, and the independence and
responsibilities of a home of her own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The merry lunch progressed; the talk fell
upon the author&#8217;s own books&mdash;and other
books. Again Hugh was surprised&mdash;and
delighted&mdash;at the lady&#8217;s discrimination and
genuine culture. It was difficult to realize
that any one who wrote so atrociously could
think and speak so well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s like Kate&#8217;s bicycle,&rdquo; he said to himself,
&ldquo;a single woman must break out somewhere.
The probabilities are, if she had a
home of her own, that she would never want to
touch a pen again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Round and round the subject hovered his
thoughts; this gentle, quiet companion for
the autumn of his life&mdash;the thought was
singularly attractive&mdash;infinitely more so than
the thought of Dora or Bee that had always
possessed also an element of distraction
alarming to a man of staid habits.</p>

<p>He looked at her with new eyes.</p>

<p>She saw the look and drooped and flushed
beneath it.</p>

<p>Then down came Kate, panting and puffing,
but quite genial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A nice way to treat your guests, Sir,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;do you know you have been away an
hour? I don&#8217;t know what Dora and Bee can
think of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.281" id="png.281"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">265</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;By George,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;I had forgotten
their very existence!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Kate, sinking comfortably on
a seat, &ldquo;others have not been so forgetful.
Two young men have arrived and have been
helping us to eat up the picnic. I have forgotten
their surnames, but the girls call them
Charlie and Graham. Medical students, I
find, who decided not to attend lectures, but
to take a run up here for the day. Clears
the brain, they told me. Heard at the hotel
that their friends were at the Falls, so just
ran down in the hope of stumbling across
them. Stumbled across them in the &lsquo;Lovers&#8217;
Nook.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;and do the little girls
seem pleased to see them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;all I can say is one of
them, Bee to be exact, has a ring on her finger
that she did not start the day with. I
discovered this by the painful efforts she made
at lunch to hide it. And I expect by this time
Dora&#8217;s finger can keep Bee&#8217;s company. They
are plainly very masterful young men, and I
fancy had determined that the mountain trip
should settle their hearts as well as clear their
brains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;I am delighted. I&#8217;ll
go up presently and drink their healths&mdash;if
there&#8217;s a bottle of champagne left. Any
more news your end of the world?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.282" id="png.282"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">266</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Kate, and calmly helped herself
to some jelly, &ldquo;Effie has developed
whooping cough while you have been away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; said Muffie, jumping with joy,
&ldquo;may we go up and play with them now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;I protest. This
is too staggering. I may not know as much
of medicine as this Charlie and Graham you
speak of, but I do know a germ&#8217;s got to be
incubated. There simply has not been
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;I have dragged it
from Florence that they foregathered purposely
some time ago with the laundress&#8217;s
little boy who has the same complaint, but
since it did not seem to have communicated
itself to them they made another trial to-day.
Well, Edith will have to leave the hotel now
and take a cottage for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little Lomaxes were dancing with
delight. Only Max was a little quiet. Teddie
Gowan did everything a little better than he,
Max, could do; it would be insupportable if
Teddie were able soon to brag that he whooped
louder than Max.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Praps mine will get worser again,&rdquo; he said
hopefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;I must go back
before much longer. Miss Bibby and I will
pack up, Hugh, and you stay quietly at the
tree ferns and mind the children.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.283" id="png.283"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">267</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hugh gently, &ldquo;you and the
children pack up, K, and I will mind Miss
Bibby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A delicate wave of colour pulsed over the
woman&#8217;s face.</p>
